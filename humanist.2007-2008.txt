X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 1 (1)

In their recent book, INEQUALITY.COM, Kieron O'Hara and David Stevens
have argued that the great revolutionary dream of the Internet's
democratization of the world turns out to be quite a mixed bag. On the
one hand, as Jon Garvie says in his summarizing review of their
argument, "Will the digital age bring equality?" (TLS 2 May 2007),
"the distribution of the power to create and store information online
has not been been matched by reduced inequality in the world at
large". Where the Internet is now a daily fact of life, there is in
fact an argument that quite the opposite has happened. "In a clever
reading of Marshall McLuhan," Garvie notes,
[deleted quotation]On the other hand, the Internet,
[deleted quotation]The closer one looks, the more the uncertainties, and not much we can
do about them directly. Toward the end of the review, however, Garvie
voices criticism which points to what we can do and in fact are doing:
[deleted quotation]Collaboration is a fine thing, but merely working together is not
enough, as the metaphor suggests in its depiction of a person's
imagined spatial entrapment within his or her surrounding sphere,
which seems all the world, but isn't. Building a common perspective
on computing -- or better, a shared way of gaining perspectives -- is
the state of maturity we've been growing ourselves into for more than
the last 20 years of Humanist's being-in-the-world, which I celebrate
today. I like to compare our socio-intellectual place to a sea-going
explorer's, on board a methodological vessel in an archipelago of
disciplines. Northrop Frye, combining the ancient definition of God
as "centre everywhere,  circumference nowhere" ("centrum ubique,
circumferentia nusquam") with Blake's metaphor of "expanding eyes",
spoke of one's own discipline-of-origin as a centre of all knowledge
that expands into all others. The key is the expanding.
I tried some of this the other day IN PUBLIC. A philosophically
inclined historian I know was giving a talk at a high-powered
specialist centre in a nearby institution, so I went to hear  him.
His talk was very good, very stimulating -- no surprise, he's
first-rate. Stimulated thereby I ventured during the question
period afterwards to connect his call for more adventurous ways of
talking about his subject to some of the more adventurous reading I
have been doing, reading well outside the discipline represented by
the specialist centre. By the sucking in of breath among the others
in the small audience and by the momentary look of panic on his face
I knew immediately that the collective disciplinary immune system had
detected invasive ideas and was immediately responding. I knew at
once that I was suddenly in the role of the talkative casually
dressed grey-bearded barking-mad nutter whom all speakers fear. Now I
was not citing reports of crop-circles, or intercourse with
extraterrestrials (cf. <a href="http://www.billymeier.com/billy_meier.htm">http://www.billymeier.com/billy_meier.htm</a>),
rather arguments made by anthropological linguists about jazz
improvisation, and other arguments by theoretical biologists about
self-organizing systems. In other words, what triggered the immune
response was the gesture of expanding. What really did it, I think,
was the word "jazz". I mean, theoretical biology is a science, and we
gotta respect THE TRUTH, right? But jazz???? According to Lafcadio
Hearn, summarizing the consensus of opinion among (white)
musicologists in 1912, the word began as *jass*,
[deleted quotation]There are problems with Hearn's etymology. The OED, more cautious
and sober, notes "Origin unknown". More interestingly, however, the
language of the context from which I've extracted this quotation is
racially polarized (e.g. "to produce the same effect in whites the further
stimulation of alcohol is needed"), suggesting that in all probability
the musicologists of the time went for a particular meaning with
conditioned alacrity -- and thereby blocked from musicological sight
for many decades aspects of jazz we have only begun to understand
fairly recently. (See e.g. Paul Berliner's magnificent Thinking in Jazz:
The Infinite Art of Improvisation, Chicago 1994.) But whatever may
be the case,  the subterranean connotations of the word retain the
power to expand the mind to the point of discomfort and stress.
But I digress.
Of course one needs to do all one can to keep from exploding, or
expanding to the point of ineffectual dissolution, or acquiring books
the reading of which demands more time than one has in the probable
remainder of one's life. One needs focus. But that does not mean
myopia or the tunnel-vision of the stiff-necked, space-cramped coal
miner, who sees sharply only what's immediately within the brightly
illuminated spot of his headlight.
These 20 years of Humanist have for its ringmaster been dedicated
not just to an expanding field of vision but to working out the
implications of the operative participle of our practice, to
"expanding eyes".
Evidence of a good result, from this and other efforts, is not just
devoutly to be wished for. It is to be found e.g. in the recent book, Mind
Technologies: Humanities Computing and the Canadian Academic
Community (Calgary, 2006), ed. Ray Siemens and David Moorman. (Read
it tonight.) I cite but a few examples, with no surprise that they
are Canadian.
In a delightful chapter, "Forswearing Thin Potations: The Creation of
Rich Texts Online", Michael Best (Professor Emeritus, Victoria,
<a href="http://www.engl.uvic.ca/Faculty/MBHomePage/">http://www.engl.uvic.ca/Faculty/MBHomePage/</a>) begins by invoking
Falstaff's declaration that, "If I had a thousand sonnes, the first
humane principle I would teach them, should be, to forsweare thin
potations, and to addict themselues to sacke". He pulls out of
Falstaff's typically corrupting inclination the wherewithal to voice
"my conviction that the way ahead for Humanities Computing lies in
taking the initiative, forswearing the thin potations consumed by
those who would have us conform to the pale demands of tradition" (p.
1). While recognizing our duty to preserve our inheritances, he goes
on to say, "I think it not an understatement to claim that there is a
powerful pressure of tradition in academia generally to be safe, to
progress through accepted and understood channels, to publish in
accepted journals and presses, to take no risks as one aspires to
tenure, promotion, and the small carrots of prestige and salary
increments that the profession offers" (p. 2). Be adventurous!
(When you can.)
At the other end of the volume, Andrew Mactavish and Geoffrey
Rockwell examine the distrust which still characterizes reactions to
computing in the humanities and find in it some complex questions
about the relation between the humanities and technology. They
examine historically as well as philosophically basic assumptions of
the humanities, asking how these are challenged by the legitimization
of technical practice (p. 229). In the Afterword, on the Canadian
TAPoR project (<a href="http://tapor1.mcmaster.ca/home.html">http://tapor1.mcmaster.ca/home.html</a>), Rockwell asks,
what are the interesting questions of humanities computing? Are they
new? He argues that development of tools arises from craft theory as
well as generates it. But this theory is rarely articulated by the
people who develop the tools, except insofar as the tool is itself an
articulation. (In what sense can this be?) For me what jumped off the
page is his statement that craft theories "come to light when we have
a sufficient number of competing tools that others need to articulate
why one would use one tool over another" (pp. 294f). Indeed -- take
text-analysis and relational database design as our prime example.
Tools are not only part of the interpretative object, he writes, they
are part of the interpretative possibilities of a text, for all texts
are embedded within or manifested by tools that authorize or make
difficult different types of interpretation. What changes, or could
change, when we use what tool?
A field in which questions of this sort can be asked, and are asked,
has come of age in an important way. Yes, so much remains to be done
-- more accurately, appears on the horizon as we approach it. We
feel, or at least I feel, so adolescent in clumsiness and so
possessed by an ignorance that compelled to speak comes out ofttimes
as arrogance. But now is no time to be a wall-flower drinking thin
potations, if any at all, under the strict gaze of sophisticated
parental traditions. Play-time. Jazz-time.
Reach for the strong stuff and drink to Humanist's continued health!

Dear colleagues,
The transition across volumes, from 20 (for the 19th year) to 21 (for
the 20th, just celebrated) was less than perfect this time, because I
didn't think to warn my technical colleague at Virginia of the
upcoming transition. And, as it happened, the software went wonky at
precisely the wrong time, so there were further delays. Hence the
great mass of messages, many of them rather late, now about to descend on you.
My apologies.

Sociotech-ID'07
Call for Papers
Workshop on new sociotechnical insights in interaction design
(September 10-11, 2007) in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil
<a href="http://iit.tvu.ac.uk/sociotech-id07">http://iit.tvu.ac.uk/sociotech-id07</a> <<a href="http://iit.tvu.ac.uk/sociotech-id07">http://iit.tvu.ac.uk/sociotech-id07</a>>
held in conjunction with the 11th IFIP TC 13 International Conference on
Human-Computer Interaction Interact'2007
<a href="http://www.interact2007.org/">http://www.interact2007.org/</a>
Aims and goals of the workshop
Diverse areas of the social sciences explore and conceptualize the
relation between people, society and technology under the rubric of
'sociotechnical', which can bring interesting insights into
interaction design. While organizational studies of technology
adoption have a well defined conceptual framework known as
sociotechnical systems theory with established principles, the
situation is not the same for interaction design research. The latter
includes examples that give diverse uses to the term 'sociotechnical'
when involving social methods and theories. While perspectives like
ethnography, ethnomethodology and activity theory have had a clear
impact in the design of interactive systems, the potential
contribution of other social science perspectives has not become so
clear and uniform despite the increased development of the pervasive
and social proxy - mediating and mediated -- characters of
interactive systems.
This workshop will bring together good examples of research in
interaction design that refer to the term 'sociotechnical'. The
challenge is to achieve some level of 'translation' despite
differences between disciplines whose main interest is under-standing
social phenomena and disciplines whose main interest is the design of
interactive systems. It is hoped the workshop will identify
opportunities for a socio-technical knowledge framework in interaction design.
Submissions are welcome in, but are not limited to, the following
topics: actionable recommendations and guidelines for the conception,
design and evaluation of interactive systems as 'social proxies';
improved methods for the gathering and elicitation of sociotechnical
requirements; identifying socially responsible policies for
interaction design; understanding participatory design as a
sociotechnical endeavor involving multidisciplinary teams in the
context of novel development methodologies such as Agile.
Submission
The following types of submission are solicited: long paper
submissions of up to 5,000 words, describing substantial
contributions of novel ongoing work; short paper submissions of up to
2,000 words, describing work in progress.  All papers must be written
and presented in English and will be peer reviewed by at least 2 reviewers.
Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and
originality of the work and to their ability to generate discussions
between the participants of the workshop. The format of submitted
papers must follow the Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer
Science) format

Subject: Call for Bids: TEI Members Meeting, Fall 2008.
Date: Tue, 08 May 2007 21:42:23 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 9 (9)

Call for Bids: TEI Members Meeting, 2008
Deadline: August 1, 2008
The annual TEI Members' Meeting takes place every year in October or
November. We are now seeking bids to host this event in 2008.
The meeting this year (2007) will take place on October 31-November 3 at
the University of Maryland in College Park, MD (USA). The previous
meetings have been:
        * Victoria, Canada, October 27-28, 2006. Hosted by the University
          of Victoria.
        * Sophia, Bulgaria, October 28-29, 2005. Hosted by the Bulgarian
          Academy of Sciences.
        * Baltimore, USA, October 22-23, 2004. Hosted by Johns Hopkins
          University.
        * Nancy, France, November 7-8 2003. Hosted by ATILF.
        * Chicago, USA, October 11-12 2002. Hosted by the Newberry Library
          and
        * Northwestern University.
        * Pisa, Italy, November 16-17 2001. Hosted by the University of
          Pisa.
The site of the meeting has typically alternated between Europe and
North America, but that is not a fixed rule. We welcome proposals from
other parts of the world, and in particular from areas where new TEI
communities are arising.
This year's meeting will be a three-day event, with approximately 70-100
attendees. The first and second day will involve plenary lectures by
invited speakers, round-table discussions, and conference-style session.
The third day will be a closed session, restricted to TEI members and
subscribers only, which includes reports on the TEI's work and the
annual elections for the TEI Board and Council. Meetings of TEI Special
Interest Groups (SIGs) are also scheduled for this day. Future meetings
should assume roughly this shape, although there is considerable room
for local initiative in consultation with the Board.
The TEI Consortium covers the direct costs in connection with the
meeting. As the TEI is an organisation with limited financial resources,
and any contribution from the host is very welcome.
Bids should be sent to info_at_tei-c.org by August 1, 2008, and should
include the following information:
        * The name of the institution(s) making the bid
        * The name, address, email, and telephone number of the contact
          person
        * A brief description of the facilities available for the event
          (rooms, equipment, technical support, food)
        * An indication of what financial support, if any, the hosting
          institution is prepared to give (for instance, sponsoring one or
          more receptions or pre-meeting workshops; payment of travel
          expenses for one or more plenary speakers; etc.)
        * Any other details that may be useful in assessing the bid (e.g.
          the presence of a conference on a related topic at the
          institution around the time of the meeting; the launch of a new
          TEI-related initiative at the institution, etc.).
All bids will be reviewed by the TEI board, which makes the final
decision.
Thank you very much!

ALT-X PRESS LAUNCHES "ILLOGIC OF SENSE: THE GREGORY L. ULMER REMIX"
AS THE LATEST ADDITION TO ITS INFLUENTIAL EBOOK SERIES
BOULDER, Colorado, May 10, 2007 --The Alt-X Online Network, a space
"where the digerati meet the literati" and on the Internet since
1993, announces the release of a new Alt-X Press ebook entitled
"Illogic of Sense: The Gregory Ulmer Remix" edited by Darren Tofts
and Lisa Gye, and designed by artist Joel Swanson of hippocrit.com.
Illogic of Sense: The Gregory L. Ulmer Remix
Edited by Darren Tofts and Lisa Gye
Design by Joel Swanson
<a href="http://www.altx.com/ebooks/ulmer.html">http://www.altx.com/ebooks/ulmer.html</a>
Contributors include Niall Lucy, Jon McKenzie, Linda Marie Walker,
Craig Saper, Rowan Wilken, Marcel O'Gorman, Teri Hoskin, and Michael
Jarrett, with an introduction by editors Tofts and Gye.
"Illogic of Sense: The Gregory L. Ulmer Remix" is an exciting new
ebook publication that employs theorist Gregory Ulmer's invocation to
invent new forms of electronic writing.  As the ebook's editors,
Darren Tofts and Lisa Gye, write in their brilliant introduction,
"Ulmer has been at the forefront of thinking about new cultural
formations as the paradigm of literacy converges with digital
culture." Ulmer's work has been central to contemporary thinking on
the future of writing and his international presence as one of the
leading figures in media arts discourse has influenced a multitude of
disciplines from electronic literature and Internet art to critical
theory, communications studies, and art history. The ebook features a
diverse group of artists, theorists, and creative writers who develop
new forms of hybridized "digital rhetoric."  Their inventive and
audacious experiments take advantage of recent developments in the
field of new media studies, and as part of Alt-X's mission to
participate in the creative commons provided by the Web, are
available for free download.
This provocative collection of multi-tracked writing puts into play
many of Ulmer's breakthrough theories summed up in his most
recognized hot-button terms: applied grammatology, heuretics,
post(e)-pedagogy, textshop, mystory, and choragraphy. Encouraged by
the example of Ulmer's own hyperrhetorical writing style, the authors
incorporate collaged imagery, mp3 soundtracks, and QuickTime movies
into their innovative multimedia mix while exploring how these same
extensions of "writerly performance" explode the false barrier
between academic discourse and spontaneous poetics, narrative and
rhetoric, and autobiography and fiction. Positing an "illogic of
sense" to reclaim what Ulmer calls an "anticipatory consciousness,"
designed to utilize the force of intuition as a way to invent
emergent forms of knowledge, this grouping of hypermedia texts
showcase how interdisciplinary writers can remix the methodological
approach of an avant-garde philosophy propelled by Ulmer, one that
prioritizes an ongoing process of discovery and media arts assemblage.
The ebook is beautifully designed by artist Joel Swanson of
hippocrit.com, who crosses his visionary design sensibility with
state of the art technology to produce an original work of ebook-art
that many will view as finally fulfilling the long-promised potential
of online publishing to use stimulating visual arrangement, media
hybridization, and typographical ingenuity to blur the distinction
between publication, exhibition, and design performance.
"Simultaneously celebrating and expanding on the writing performances
located in Gregory Ulmer's rich oeuvre of totally remixable source
material, the collection of essays in 'Illogic of Sense' adhere to an
experiential approach to creative/critical writing and in so doing
teach us how to write a theory of poetics that will help us invent a
new field of study that I would call interdisciplinary digital
humanities." - Mark Amerika, series editor, Alt-X Press; author of
"META/DATA: A Digital Poetics" (MIT Press, 2007)

Subject: Text Visualization
Date: Fri, 11 May 2007 16:18:45 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 21 (21)

I'm researching a book on visualization in the digital humanities and
need some views from those working in text visualization. I've
reviewed visualization of quantitative data, spatial data and
temporal data and there is plenty of support for the new
visual methods.
When I came to eamine text visualization things were very
different. My difficulty is that many of the people I've spoken
to argue that the more imaginative visualizations of text are merely
decorative and we have not seen much in the way of useful insight
emerging from the use of such visualizations. Is this really an
accurate assessment?
I come from a background of visualization of spatial and quantitative
data and can see how adaptions of statistical graphics mesh well with
'conventional' text analysis but I'm interested in the more creative
applications such as word brush, word rain and similar imaginative
tools present in projects like TAPoR and TextARC.
I'd like to keep things simple and not risk limiting the discussion so
I will not say more at this stage. So are the "blobby clusters" and
"concept shapes" of text visualizations a waste of time or are visual
analysis strategies providing useful insights which are being translated
into concrete research outcomes?

for graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies)
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural
Language Processing to present their current work and receive
constructive feedback and guidance on future research, both from the
general audience and the invited lecturers at the Summer School.
The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4
consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in the second week of the
EUROLAN 2007 Summer School, July 30 - August 2, 2007. The final
version of the accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings
of the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium, at the University Al. I.
Cuza Publishing House. During the Summer School the students will
present their work, will receive constructive comments wrt. to
current and future research directions from a panel of established
researchers, and will benefit from the collaborative climate
established among all participants, thus enhancing future joint work
among them. Students will also prepare a poster which will be on
display throughout the Summer School.
We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to
the Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors
to receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.
The research being presented can be from any topic area within
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, including
but not limited to:
    * phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
    * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax, and the lexicon;
    * text understanding and generation;
    * computational semantics;

Date: Sat, 12 May 2007 06:53:54 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 24 (24)

This is a good question: we had quite a discussion about it in the halls
at the TEI meeting last year in Victoria. A couple of the papers there
used quite interesting text visualisations, but the issue of usefulness
came up.
I often wonder about literary text processing if it is not better to see
many techniques as tools of very focussed (a more positive term than
limited) application. One good visualisation used to be in the old
Multidoc SGML browser: it drew a cluster diagram of search hits in the
scroll bar, which really helped navigation. Another useful tool I think
I remember is the results of the stemma diagrams you can get for
individual variants in the Canterbury Tales Project.
This seems to me to be typical of the best usage of such things. I used
to be struck in dealing with digital editions of the number of tools
editors provided me with that I didn't think I'd need and certainly had
never imagined I would. In literary research, I think that's because the
goals of processors/tool designers and literary scholars are quite
different. Tools are good for doing a specific task very well along a
single plane. But literary and textual researchers rarely ask
single-plane questions--which is why literary research is such a magpie
field. So I think there is very often a sense of "that's it?" when we
seen something like a text visualisation: it is a very complex tool that
tends to answer a relatively simple question--clustering, or the like.

I don't know what you mean by text visualisation. If you mean semantic
mapping I can suggest you look at Leximancer (www.leximancer.com). It
is a commercial product and I am ashamed to say on this discussion
group that I work on it. However, advertisements aside, Leximancer
deduces the semantic content of a set of texts, which can be huge, in a
variety of formats (pdf, word, rtf, html, xml, text, csv), works out
what the key concepts are and produces a semantic map that you can
click on and explore. There are some examples on the Leximancer website
- try the "case studies". What it gives you when run on its own is a
semantic key to the whole work - lets you see what a body of text says
without actually reading it. The web version is  limited in that you
can't zoom in but the desktop version can expand the map to full screen
and then you can do two-concept combinations, say "emperor" and "power"
in the Gibbon example and it gives you all the passages where the two
CONCEPTs co-occur. The actual words "emperor" and "power" may not occur
in all passages cited because it is a semantic index. What I mean is
that passages where "kennel", "bone" and "barking" occur are obviously
about "dog" but that's a semantic link, not a textual one. If you want
to seed it with several concepts, to compare and contrast ideas in a
particular text you can do that too, or add tags by simply putting
texts into various folders - we did things like comparing debates from
different sides of the houses of parliament by just dropping the
liberal debates into one folder and labour ones in another. It also
does spreadsheets, taking the column headings as tags, so you can do
survey results. The good thing about this approach is that it is
unbiased. It doesn't rely on human tagging. It is grounded theory as it
should be - the meaning emerges from the text. The trial is free for
one month. There will be a new version soon for enterprise use that is
also much faster (this is what I am working on). Leximancer is not
decorative. It is a very practical tool that we have sold all over the
world to government agencies, lawyers, police forces, and academics
doing research.

Martyn Jessop's question is of deep interest to me since
visualization is a central concern of the Monk Project (http://
monkproject.org) for which my tag line is "Towards a billion words of
written English from four centuries in a metadata rich environment."
MONK stands for Metadata Offer New Knowledge.
One might begin with the observation that text is always already
visualization since it is 'drawn language'. And one might further
observe that there are a lot of graphic designers on and off the web
who will go to almost any length to make text less readable. From
that perspective you can understand the response of austere readers
who want readable text and for whom anything else interferes with the
only visualization that really matters: make it easy to see the text you read.
But if 'text' becomes 'data' in whatever environment and for whatever
reason you don't 'read' but look at results that are in some form
tabulated or quantified. For instance, the Philologic search engine
lets you scan across some 600 million words of English, pick out
144,000 occurrences of various spellings and grammatical forms of
'liberty' and will return results by decade and frequency per 10,000
words. These results are much more easily interpreted as a chart
because you "see" at once that there are quite sharp spikes in the
1650's and 1680's.
So there is a fairly simple but stringent test for visualization:
does it help you "see" things in the strong cognitive sense of the
word?  Such seeing is subject to no more or less distortion than in
other forms of visualization. State of the Union addresses are now
routinely analyzed in terms of word frequency and increased
frequencies are marked by bigger circles. If a word is used twice as
often and the radius of the circle is doubled, the area of the circle
is four times as large. Is that a new form of deception or does it
help you "see" something more clearly?
There is a statistic called Dunning's log likelihood ratio, which
shows you what words in text A are disproportionately common or
uncommon when compared with Text B. These lists provide surprisingly
effective keywords for interpretation. A plain list will certainly
do. But something might be said for representing this last as a cast
of character that drift across the screen as thinly scrawled or big
and fat letters.
The trouble with this and other forms of visualization is that it is
more fun to be cool than true.

[deleted quotation]I would strongly recommend soliciting Johanna Drucker for a copy of
her "Graphesis" essay, which addresses this question directly. The
frequent characterization of aesthetics that are beautiful or cool but
also, somehow, "merely" ornamental or decorative is one of the most
stifling in our field, IMO, and needs to be challenged with a robust
theoretical conversation. Johanna's piece is the first step. Matt

Hi Martyn,
I work in this area and so would naturally say there is some good
work being done, but much of it may not yet have translated into
concrete research outcomes.
I make the distinction between scientific visualization and
humanities visualization in that the former converts primarily
numeric data into visual forms for manipulation, while the latter
works with elements consisting of text or image displayed in
unconventional ways. I'm guessing your own definition would have more
to do with content areas than with visual elements.
We've been working recently in the MONK project (www.monkproject.org)
on  a visualization issue raised by Tanya Clement, who is interested
in repetition with variation in Gertrude Stein's novel The Making of
Americans. How can someone see patterns of repetitions across a
thousand pages, or as Tanya sometimes says, 3000 paragraphs? We have
a session at SDH-SEMI at the end of May outlining three projects
dealing with this topic. Catherine Plaisant and her postdoc Anthony
Don at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at University of Maryland
have also created a working prototype that displays 3-grams. It is
online here: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/textvis/featurelens">http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/textvis/featurelens</a>
I hope this is some help.

My colleague Martyn Jessop's question is an excellent one. It's
interesting to me that questions of this form are being asked in all
sorts of other areas, perhaps because the level of activity is now
such that there are many examples of work to wonder about.
Presentation tools of various sorts make it relatively easy to get
something demonstrable out there, the most immediately striking of
which are visualizations. It's healthy to be called to account. But
at the same time, one has to be able to act on intuitions and
convictions not supported by much if any evidence. One has to have
the liberty to follow one's nose, to invest significant amounts of
resources to create something in order to see what will happen.
Otherwise true innovation becomes shackled by the known and predictable.
There are tensions here of course, and they get worse the more it
costs to work forward into the unknown. But we should be clear about
what's involved in going where no one has gone before. Sometimes it
may be better to go it alone and relatively unaided rather that
require a costly spaceship.
Yours,

Subject: EpiDoc Summer School, 11-15 June, 2007
Date: Tue, 15 May 2007 06:52:11 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 39 (39)

Over the last few years an international group of scholars has been
developing a set of conventions for marking up ancient documents in XML
for publication and interchange. The EpiDoc Guidelines started from the
case of inscriptions, but the principles are also being applied to
papyri and coins, and the aim has always been to produce standards
consistent with those of the Text Encoding Initiative, used for all
literary and linguistic texts.
Following on from the interest we have seen in EpiDoc training events
(including recent sessions in Rome and San Diego) and the success of the
London EpiDoc summer school over several years now, we shall be holding
another week-long workshop here at King's College London, from the
11th-15th June this year.
-- The EpiDoc Guidelines provide a schema and associated tools and
recommendations for the use of XML to publish epigraphic and
papyrological texts in interchangeable format. For a fuller description
of the project and links to tools and guidelines see <a href="http://epidoc.sf.net">http://epidoc.sf.net</a>.
-- The Summer School will offer an in-depth introduction to the use of
XML and related technologies for publication and interchange of
epigraphic and papyrological editions.
-- The event will be hosted by the Centre for Computing in the
Humanities, King's College London, which will provide the venue and
tuition. The school is free of charge, but attendees will need to fund
their own travel, accommodation, and subsistence. (There may be cheap
accommodation available through KCL; please inquire.)
-- The summer school is targeted at epigraphic and papyrological scholars
(including professors, post-docs, and advanced graduate students) with
an interest and willingness to learn some of the hands-on technical
aspects necessary to run a digital project (even if they would not be
marking-up texts by hand very much themselves). Knowledge of
Greek/Latin, the Leiden Conventions and the distinctions expressed by
them, and the kinds of data and metadata that need to be recorded by
philologists and ancient historians, will be an advantage. Please
enquire if you're unsure. No particular technical expertise is required.
-- Attendees will require the use of a relatively recent laptop computer
(Win XP+ or Mac OSX 10.3+), with up-to-date Java installation, and
should acquire a copy of the oXygen XML editor (educational discount and
one-month free trial available); they should also have the means to
enter Unicode Greek from the keyboard. Full technical specifications and
advice are available on request. (CCH may be able to arrange the loan of
a prepared laptop for the week; please inquire asap.)
Places on the workshop will be limited so if you are interested in
attending the summer school, or have a colleague or student who might be
interested, please contact gabriel.bodard_at_kcl.ac.uk as soon as possible
with a brief statement of qualifications and interest.

WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules are key components of a
model-driven approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy.
VORTE 2007 is the third workshop associated with an EDOC conference that
intends to bring together researchers and practitioners in areas such as
philosophical ontology, enterprise modelling, information systems,
Semantic Web, Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), business rules, and
business processes. The goal of the workshop is to discuss the role that
foundational and domain ontologies play in the conceptual development
and implementation of next generation tools for enterprise computing.
Since enterprise vocabularies and ontologies, as well as business rules
do not exist in isolation but serve to support business processes, THIS
YEAR WE ARE PLANNING TO PUT SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON
BUSINESS PROCESS MODELLING AND MANAGEMENT.
THEMES AND TOPICS
The workshop contributions will be organized along four major thematic
areas, under which the following topics of interest will be included,
but not limited to:
* Conceptual Modelling
- Business Vocabularies, Terminologies, and Taxonomies
- Ontological Approaches to Content and Knowledge Management
- Enterprise Information Integration and Interoperability
- Service Taxonomies and Service Registries (for example, UDDI-related
research)
- Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modelling
- Languages for Conceptual Modelling (for example, OWL and UML)
- Agent-Oriented Conceptual Modelling
* Business Rules and Business Process Semantics
- Semantic Web Services
- Service Ontologies (for example, research related to OWL-S)
- Business Rule Languages and Components
- Rule-based Approaches to Web Service Policies and Choreographies
- Ontologies for Business Process Management
- Agent-based Business Rule and Process Management
- Business Process Modelling and Execution Languages (for example, BPMN
and BPML)
* Ontologies for Enterprise Computing
- Foundational Ontologies and Enterprise Computing
- Ontological Evaluation of Enterprise Systems
- Ontologies for Interoperability of Enterprise Systems
- Ontology-based Enterprise Architectures
- Ontology-based Software Engineering for Enterprises
- Enterprise Components' Modelling
* Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approaches to Enterprise Computing
- Modelling and Architecture Frameworks
- Domain Engineering
- Domain-specific Business Information and System Engineering
- Transformation between MDA layers
SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee. Submissions should be 6 to 8 pages long and MUST use
the two-column format of IEEE conference proceedings, which is
referenced on the workshop's web site, and include the authors' name,
affiliation, and contact details. Papers must be submitted in the PDF
format using EasyChair at <a href="http://www.easychair.org/VORTE2007">http://www.easychair.org/VORTE2007</a>. Authors

Methods Network Workshop
TEXT MINING FOR HISTORIANS workshop at University of Glasgow 17 - 18
July 2007
A workshop organized by Zoe Bliss, AHDS History and the Association
for History and Computing UK (AHC-UK)
Texts are central to historical research and an increasing body of
historical texts are becoming available in electronic format. Despite
a long-standing interest in computer aided text analysis the use of
computer assisted methods and tools are not widespread amongst
historians.
This workshop aims to:
*Introduce participants to the methods and tools developed and
currently employed by corpus linguists
*Provide practical hands on experience of using these tools
*Enable participants to explore the pros and cons of employing these
tools and methods in historical research.
It builds upon the successful Methods Network Workshop on Historical
Text Mining in Lancaster in July 2006 (http://
www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act6.html).
The workshop is aimed at academic staff and post graduates whose
research involves the analysis of significant bodies of textual
material and who would like to know more about computerised
techniques and tools that they could potentially use to aid their
research. Moreover, the workshop will be particularly useful for
researchers who would like practical hands on experience of using
these tools. The workshop is free of charge, with lunch and
refreshments included.

register, please visit: <a href="http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/">http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/</a> act25.html
The AHRC ICT Methods Network exists to promote and support the
application of advanced ICT methods in the arts and humanities.
Please see the Methods Network website for details about further

[deleted quotation]Hi Caroline,
This is an interesting problem; one in that I have come across
before. I am not sure exactly what you are trying to do, but in the
Australian system (the one in which I have the most experience), the
creation of an online resources isn't seen as research in itself
unless it somehow advances ICT methods and creates new knowledge
about those methods and the content that is being digitised (if this
makes sense). The project that I am working on here in the UK, ICT
Guides, has some information on this in the UK system.

(a registered trademark of IDEAlliance)
THE MARKUP THEORY & PRACTICE CONFERENCE
Extreme is the leading international conference on markup theory and=
  practice.
If you have interesting markup applications, difficult markup problems, or
intriguing solutions to problems related to the design and use of markup,
markup languages, or markup tools; if you want to know what the leading
theorists of markup are thinking; if you are the house markup expert and
want to spend time with your kind, then you should plan on attending
Extreme Markup Languages(r) 2007.
ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
Extreme is an open marketplace of theories about markup and all the
things that they support or that support them: the difficult cases in
publishing, linguistics, transformation, searching, indexing, and storage
and retrieval. At Extreme, markup enthusiasts gather each year to trade
in ideas, not to convince management to buy new stuff. At Extreme we push
the edges of markup theory & practice.

I'd very much appreciate help in locating lists and discussions of
criteria for the peer-review of digital scholarly objects. In
simplest form, such criteria overlap with those for evaluating
websites, but what I'm really interested in is how one might go about
reviewing complex digital objects. Best would be those at a
sufficiently high level of abstraction as to suit whatever one might
encounter, but those specific to particular kinds of objects would
also be quite useful, as would articles on the process of reviewing
digital objects.
Many thanks.

I'm working on something similar but focussed specifically on
visualization projects in the digital humanities. I've found the
London Charter very useful. It deals with one aspect of humanities
computing, 3D visualization, applied to a very specific subject area;
cultural heritage but I am using it as a framework for a wider study.
The URL of the charter is <a href="http://www.londoncharter.org/">http://www.londoncharter.org/</a>.
It aims to produce a set of principles to ensure intellectual
integrity, reliability, transparency, documentation, standards,
sustainability and access. These are surely the qualities that should
be assessed in peer review. There is also a purpose beyond peer
review "to ensure that such work is intellectually and technically
rigorous, and for its potential in this domain to be realised, there
is a need both to establish standards responsive to the particular
properties of 3d visualization, and to identify those that it should
share with other methods."  It sets out nine principles concerning
1.	Subject Communities
2.	Aims and Methods
3.	Sources
4.	Transparency Requirements
5.	Documentation
6.	Standards
7.	Sustainability
8.	Access
My paper at Digital Humanities 2007 in June will present some of the
work that I have based upon it for visualization projects in the humanities
as a whole.
My next point is rather more tightly focussed than you requested but I
think it is a particularly important aspect of peer review, (also
covered in the charter). It concerns 'paradata', i.e. documentation
about the research process; why particular decisions were made etc. I
recently attended a combined arts/sciences/humanities workshop and
the discussion of the importance of lab books to scientists struck a
chord. They fulfill a far more important role in scientific research
than I had realised. Artists document their research processes in
different ways but again for similar ends. Perhaps it's a practice we
should adopt in the digital humanities?

Subject: Coding and Composing
Date: Fri, 18 May 2007 06:39:44 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 53 (53)

An interesting article, "Code and Composition", zipped by on Humanist
a few days ago in an announcement of the latest Ubiquity
(<a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/">http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/</a>) -- an online magazine that sometimes
publishes little gems. In this article Luke Fernandez compares the
two modes of expression and finds them convergent: writing, not
entirely spontaneous, involves planning and research; coding, not
entirely planned, involves discovery during the act of composition.
In this attempt at a parallel, the first seems obvious, if a bit
overstated, but the second seems to contradict official stories of
how writing code should proceed. What is the experience of people
here? I understand that nowadays no one or few preaches the doctrine
that a complete specification must be devised beforehand (as I was
told when I learned many years ago). I think the need to come up with
a complete flowchart is what put me off programming eventually, along
with the dreaded "turn-around time" of 2 hrs minimum. In any case, it
would be interesting to know how exploratory programming is known to
be these days.
Some of you here will be familiar with Brian Cantwell Smith's
argument, in "The Limits of Correctness" (1985), later published in
1995 as "The Limits of Correctness in Computers", (Computers, Ethics
& Social Values. Ed. Deborah G. Johnson and Helen Nissenbaum. 456-69.
Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice Hall) that a fundamental problem we
have with computing is the whole idea of correctness in any
algorithmically rigorous description of the world. Fernandez's
argument leads me to the thought that the problem with the problem of
correctness is in the assumption of a final statement -- and that
this applies to writing prose as much as to programming, though with
different consequences. As long as correctness is deferred but still
a goal we're on the right track.
Comments?
Yours,
WM

Call for papers:
PRACTICAL CRITICISM AND ITS LEGACIES
An international conference to be hosted by the
English Research Institute at Manchester
Metropolitan University, 26th-- 27th June 2008.
Conference website:
<a href="http://www.eri.mmu.ac.uk/events/legacies-of-practical-criticism/">http://www.eri.mmu.ac.uk/events/legacies-of-practical-criticism/</a>
Confirmed keynote speakers:
Professor Ben Knights, Director of the HEA English Subject Centre
Dr Gary Day, De Montfort University
I. A. Richards' foundational text Practical
Criticism, which he described as  "in part =85 the
recoord of a piece of field-work in comparative
ideology", was published by Cambridge University
Press in 1929. Its methodological and theoretical
assumptions constitute the basis of all
subsequent teaching and much critical analysis of
literary texts. Practical criticism is still the
first mode of encounter with literary texts for
most students, and major traditions of literary
analysis and theory, from New Critical approaches
to deconstruction, from psychological and
psychoanalytic approaches to linguistic and
reader-response theories, owe conceptual and
methodological debts to Richards' project in
Practical Criticism. The book provided a series
of models for the reading of texts, the
comprehension of contexts, and the processes of
interpretation, analysis and composition, which
has influenced subsequent critical practice in profound ways.
This conference will explore the arguments and
assumptions, influences and legacies, reactions
against and developments from, and contemporary
versions of and responses to the traditions of
critical reading established by Richards' text. A
selection of the papers will be included in a
planned volume marking in 2009 the 80th
anniversary of the publication of Practical
Criticism. Proposals are invited for papers of 20
minutes duration which may consider, but are not
restricted to, the following themes:
-  pre-cursors and origins of Richards'
methodologies and practices: close reading before Practical Criticism
-  the publishing history of Practical Criticism =AD editionss and variations
-  theorising and historicising versions of
practical criticism in practice: close reading,
blind reading, textual analysis, passage comprehension
-  Richards' methods, categories, arguments,
strategies: ethical, political and practical implications
-  Richards, Leavis, Empson and reading the English canon
-  Practical Criticism and European and American literary theories
-  Objective and subjective readings, negotiated
meaning, protocols and stock responses in literary analysis
-  Cognitive approaches to practical criticism; schema theory and other models
-  Practical criticism of prose, drama, poetry
-  Practical criticism and reader-response theories
-  Practical criticism and efferent / aesthetic reading
-  Practical criticism and identity politics
-  Practical criticism and genre theory
-  Languages of practical critical analysis; rhetorics, terminologies, terms
-  Tracing the influences of Practical Criticism
on subsequent critical and theoretical developments in literary analysis
-  Practical criticism in contemporary teaching and learning
-  Practical criticism and models of creativity
-  Re-reading Practical Criticism in the light of recent theory and post-theory
-  Practical criticism and deconstruction
-  Practical criticism and linguistic criticism
-  Practical criticism and new media; digital and other textualities
-  Applications of practical criticism outside literary studies
-  Futures of practical criticism in and outside the academy

Subject: CFP: Case Studies in Research: Knowledge and Inquiry
Date: Mon, 21 May 2007 06:37:47 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 57 (57)

Call for Papers:
Design Research Quarterly
announces a new series of articles:
Case Studies in Research: Knowledge and Inquiry
'we want to hold a discussion
on how research steers theory'
Call for Papers:
Designers use the term 'design' to cover a wide range of
activities and types of problems, and we have many differing,
often incommensurable and opposing models of
design and its theoretical and methodological bases. As a
result, we also have have a history of lively debates over specific
theories. These debates have not been able to resolve
differences.
Many regions of design are not well defined, and in such
situations, researchers can find that apparently straightforward
problems can lead to fundamental questions about the
nature of design, what kinds of philosophical and theoretical
positions that can frame the research and ground the methods,
and their implications with regard to knowledge: what
kinds of knowledge are possible within the frames needed
to do the research.
In short, we want to hold a discussion on how research
steers theory. Our idea is to look at research and theories in
design not primarily as related to subfields per se, but to see
theories as products of research problems themselves: the
topics studied studied and the questions being researched.
Rather than look at abstract problems of research and
theory, we want to present actual problems as case studies.
In this way, we can clarify design by mapping its terrain
of activities and problem types with their fundamental theoretical
and methodological requirements.
Over the next two years, DRQ will collect and publish
articles on these topics and replies to those articles, using
its regular publication schedule to build a discussion. If you
have an interest or idea for an article or other submission,
please contact the editor, Peter Storkerson.

--
Topics:
We seek papers that explore issues including:
- ontological and epistemological implications or require-
ments of a research problem
- status of knowledge, its bases and levels of certainty
- conflicts between the knowledge that is possible in a
given situation and the research goals.
-how research fits into fundamental paradigms: scien-
tific, humanist, phenomenological, pragmatic, etc., and
how those approaches compare in their strengths and
weaknesses
- working across the boundaries of humanism and science:
the extent to which a research problem requires use
of more than one basic philosophical frame and how different
frames can be reconciled
Specifications:
3,ooo to 6,000 words

Hi Willard,
I can only comment on the bit about correctness and modelling. It
seems to me that the paper you cite by Mr Smith conflates two
separate issues: that of proving programs correct and modelling. He
says they are connected historically. That may be true or not - he
cites no sources for most of his statements - but I remain
unconvinced of the importance of the link. Program correctness is
supposed to eliminate errors in programs. You state a set of
preconditions and prove by translating the programming instructions
into mathematical assertions and by using various rules to prove that
the postcondition also holds. That has nothing much to do with
modelling that I can see. Where you get the preconditions from
perhaps has something to do with modelling, but it's a bit like
saying that the house a builder makes is well-built according to the
desires of the eventual owner because he used a spirit level in building it.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 61 (61)

Dear Humanist colleagues, the discussion about reviewing process is
quite on time. My article was turned away because the reviewer wrote
that I use the Chi-square criterion in the way it was used 30 years
ago. I am a linguist but I guess that the calcilation of the
Chi-square should be the same then and now. Am I not correct? I
wonder if anyone can help me to calculate it in the modern way? For
example, we have 22 Verbials in Agatha Christie and 8 - in J.K.
Rowling. Both texts are of the equal size 10 000 words. I calculated
the Chi-square as 6.53. It means that there is a statistical
difference between them at the level of 5%, since the table value is
3.84. I wonder if I calculate it correctly. Looking forward to
hearing from you to <mailto:yutamb_at_mail.ru>yutamb_at_mail.ru Yours

[deleted quotation]Hi Caroline,
This is an interesting problem; one in that I have come across
before. I am not sure exactly what you are trying to do, but in the
Australian system (the one in which I have the most experience), the
creation of an online resources isn't seen as research in itself
unless it somehow advances ICT methods and creates new knowledge
about those methods and the content that is being digitised (if this
makes sense). The project that I am working on here in the UK, ICT
Guides, has some information on this in the UK system.

Subject: understanding online
Date: Tue, 22 May 2007 07:09:35 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 64 (64)

Ostensible acceptance without understanding is a 
cheat. And we're the ones cheated. Having some 
part of a person's research in digital form is no 
longer a dirty secret to be concealed, indeed we 
exhibit the fact so that we may be considered 
up-to-date. But with some, young (undergraduate 
students) and old (colleagues), a "web page" is 
merely a web page. Anyone can do it, everyone 
does. It may be e-valu-ated with the help of 
widely published criteria as either good or bad, 
but its kind is not questioned. Few ask the 
harder question, what *kind* of knowledge is this 
resource giving me? How is that kind shaped by 
the fact that the resource is online?
Ask yourself, how often is the specifically 
digital scholarship in a digital resource 
described by anyone? An historian comes to a 
technical practitioner, let us say. A long, 
probing conversation, taking place over many 
weeks or months, then ensues. The historian's 
view of his or her original questions and sources 
is profoundly affected. (We know this happens 
from individual testimony.) The technical 
practitioner's understanding of his or her craft 
is likewise affected. Let us say that a brilliant 
piece of work results. (We know this happens 
too.) The resource is put online, historians of 
the period and area flock to it virtually. A 
great success. BUT who writes about the profound 
changes to individuals' understanding of their 
fields? Who studies these effects so that 
anecdotes become evidence for a scholarship *of* 
as well as in the digital medium?
Let us say, perhaps unfairly, that no one, or 
very few, write about these changes. As a result, 
their articulate existence remains only in the 
form of promotional claims made to support some 
ill-understood thing called "ICT". Among 
scholars, among the professors of the 
institutions, the only visible, real aspect of 
the resource is its historical, or literary, or 
linguistic, or whatever kind of scholarship, 
which thus seems to float free of its digital 
instantiation. When the "web page" is mentioned, 
it is only a web page, no different from any 
other, therefore not scholarship, except to 
"content specialists" (another pernicious term), 
who tends not to regard its online existence as 
anything other than a convenience.
I suppose some progress has been made, in the 
sense that the servant is paid, and sometimes 
even fted. But the servant remains a servant, 
and much quiet damage is done. So much more is 
possible! (I note the postdoc advertised in 
today's lot of Humanist. A good sign.)
Yours,
WM

"My Booke of Rememberance"
The Autobiography of Elizabeth Isham
Editied by Isaac Stephens
After the recent discovery of a previously unknown
seventeenth-century autobiography written by Elizabeth Isham from the
manuscript collections of Princeton University, Isaac Stephens, a PhD
candidate in British history at the University of California,
Riverside, has produced an online edition of the autobiography and
posted it at the following URL:
<<a href="http://www.history.ucr.edu/people/grad_students/stephens/index.html">http://www.history.ucr.edu/people/grad_students/stephens/index.html</a>><a href="http://www.history.ucr.edu/people/grad_students/stephens/index.html">http://www.history.ucr.edu/people/grad_students/stephens/index.html</a> 
or

In addition, the Northamptonshire Record Society Press is to publish
a forthcoming annotated edition of Stephens' transcription.  The
autobiography is also the foundation of his nearly completed
dissertation, "In the Shadow of the Patriarch: Elizabeth Isham and
Her World in Seventeenth-Century Northamptonshire," a micro-history
on Isham's life and world.  His dissertation and edition of Elizabeth
Isham's autobiography should prove of interest to both literary
scholars and historians alike.

Dear Colleagues,
This is just to remind you that the deadline for funding applications to
the AHRC ICT Methods Network is 30 June 2007.
The AHRC ICT Methods Network invites the arts and humanities Higher
Education community in the UK to submit proposals for Methods Network
activities. Activities may include workshops, seminars, focused
workgroups, postgraduate training events and publications.
The Methods Network is keen to support both single- and
cross-disciplinary proposals and those that encourage new collaborative
frameworks between technical specialists and arts and humanities
researchers. The primary emphasis is on the use and reuse of digital
resources.
Proposals for hybrid activities such as workshop/seminar/workgroup
combinations are also welcomed, as are proposals for any other activity
which falls within the Methods Network remit to support and promote the
uses of advanced ICT methods in academic research.
Funding of up to 5000 is available for workshops and hybrid activities.
Workshops provide training in advanced ICT methods for community members
within academic institutions. They engage with issues such as: formal
methods in analysis of source data and the creation of technical models;
working with multiple technologies; and other matters of vital practical
interest to the community.
Funding of up to 2000 is available for seminars. These may concentrate
on highly-defined topics of interest and also problem areas within the
community or may have a more general focus.
For information on eligibility and how to apply for funding see the
Methods Network website (www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk).
Please be aware that all applicants are expected to submit fully-formed
proposals with full programme, budget and projected outcome details and
with particular emphasis on the research significance of the proposed
activity. Applications that fail to provide all required details will
not be considered for funding. For further information about submitting
a proposal contact Hazel Gardiner (hazel.gardiner_at_kcl.ac.uk).
Forthcoming Methods Network Funded Activities
We welcome applications from individuals who would like to attend
Methods Network workshops and seminars, but must emphasise that
registration is essential for these activities. Participants are also
expected to make an active contribution to the activity. Occasionally a
Methods Network event will be by invitation only, but all resulting
materials, including (where appropriate) podcasts, wikis, training
workbooks, reports and publications will be made freely available to the
community via the Methods Network website. All enquiries about
registration for the Methods Network activities listed below should be

The Grant Institute's Grants 101: Professional Grant Proposal Writing
Workshop will be held at North Dakota State University , August 1 - 3,
2007. Interested development professionals, researchers, faculty, and
graduate students should register as soon as possible, as demand means
that seats will fill up quickly. Please forward, post, and distribute
this e-mail to your colleagues and listservs.
All participants will receive certification in professional grant
writing from the Institute. For more information call (888) 824 - 4424

Please find the program description below:
The Grant Institute
Grants 101: Professional Grant Proposal Writing Workshop
will be held at
North Dakota State University
Fargo, North Dakota
August 1 3, 2007
8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
The Grant Institute's Grants 101 course is an intensive and detailed
introduction to the process, structure, and skill of professional
proposal writing. This course is characterized by its ability to act as
a thorough overview, introduction, and refresher at the same time. In
this course, participants will learn the entire proposal writing process
and complete the course with a solid understanding of not only the ideal
proposal structure, but a holistic understanding of the essential
factors, which determine whether or not a program gets funded. Through
the completion of interactive exercises and activities, participants
will complement expert lectures by putting proven techniques into
practice. This course is designed for both the beginner looking for a
thorough introduction and the intermediate looking for a refresher
course that will strengthen their grant acquisition skills. This class,
simply put, is designed to get results by creating professional grant
proposal writers.
Participants will become competent program planning and proposal writing
professionals after successful completion of the Grants 101 course. In
three active and informative days, students will be exposed to the art
of successful grant writing practices, and led on a journey that ends
with a masterful grant proposal.
Grants 101 consists of three (3) courses that will be completed during
the three-day workshop.
(1) Fundamentals of Program Planning
This course is centered on the belief that "it's all about the program."
This intensive course will teach professional program development
essentials and program evaluation. While most grant writing "workshops"
treat program development and evaluation as separate from the writing of
a proposal, this class will teach students the relationship between
overall program planning and grant writing.
(2) Professional Grant Writing
Designed for both the novice and experienced grant writer, this course
will make each student an overall proposal writing specialist. In
addition to teaching the basic components of a grant proposal,
successful approaches, and the do's and don'ts of grant writing, this
course is infused with expert principles that will lead to a mastery of
the process. Strategy resides at the forefront of this course's intent
to illustrate grant writing as an integrated, multidimensional, and
dynamic endeavor. Each student will learn to stop writing the grant and
to start writing the story. Ultimately, this class will illustrate how
each component of the grant proposal represents an opportunity to use
proven techniques for generating support.
(3) Grant Research
At its foundation, this course will address the basics of foundation,
corporation, and government grant research. However, this course will
teach a strategic funding research approach that encourages students to
see research not as something they do before they write a proposal, but
as an integrated part of the grant seeking process. Students will be
exposed to online and database research tools, as well as publications
and directories that contain information about foundation, corporation,
and government grant opportunities. Focusing on funding sources and
basic social science research, this course teaches students how to use
research as part of a strategic grant acquisition effort.
Registration
$597.00 tuition includes all materials and certificates.
Each student will receive:
*The Grant Institute Certificate in Professional Grant Writing
*The Grant Institute's Guide to Successful Grant Writing
*The Grant Institute Grant Writer's Workbook with sample proposals,
forms, and outlines

Subject: on awareness
Date: Wed, 23 May 2007 06:34:59 +0100

Martin E. Mller, "Being aware: where we think the action is",
Cognition, Technology & Work 9.2 (June 2007): 109-126.
Abstract.  The term awareness has become one of 
the core concepts in human (computer-) 
interaction. By awareness we usually try to 
describe a human&#x2019;s capability of perception and 
the cognitive effort related to an apperception 
task as well as similar abilities of a computer 
system to act sensitively with respect to 
context. But what does it mean to be aware in or 
of some context? Are not all things assembled in 
a system affected by being in that system -- 
being aware of it or not? What does it take to be 
aware and what are the consequences of being not 
aware? This article discusses recent paradigms of 
computer science in the context of philosophy of 
mind, psychology of perception and sociology to 
shed light on awareness, context, perception and 
affection. The conclusion that is drawn is that 
any observation is inherently predetermined by 
our model of the world: the meaning of data we 
collect is determined by the model assumptions 
under which the observer is running.

This collection of writings explores the theory and praxis of technicity
in contemporary thought. From the ground-breaking explorations of such
figures as Freud, Heidegger, Deleuze/Guattari and Derrida to the work of
more recent theorists like Bernard Stiegler, Friedrich Kittler and
Katherine Hayles, it is becoming possible to speak of a new
"technological turn" in contemporary continental theory. Yet despite the
plethora of work in the field there has not been any sustained attempt
to think through the larger philosophical, cultural and political
implications of the new technologies.
In this collection, a group of internationally-known figures within the
fields of philosophy, linguistics and cultural studies come together to
consider the meaning of "technicity" at the beginning of the 21st
century.

4th International Workshop on Constraints and Language Processing
                20-21 August 2007, Roskilde, Denmark
                 <a href="http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2007.html">http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2007.html</a>
Affiliated with CONTEXT07, <a href="http://context-07.ruc.dk">http://context-07.ruc.dk</a>
DEADLINE for submissions: May 29, 2007 - EXTENDED
The CSLP_at_Context07 workshop considers the role of constraints in
the representation of language and the implementation of language
processing. This theme should be interpreted inclusively:
contributions from linguistics, computer science, psycholinguistics
and related areas are welcome, and an interdisciplinary perspective
is of particular interest.
The collocation with the CONTEXT07 conference underlines the
application of constraints for context comprehension and discourse
modelling.
Motivation
----------
Constraints are widely used in linguistics, computer science, and
psychology. How they are used, however, varies widely according to the
research domain: knowledge representation, cognitive modelling,
problem solving mechanisms, etc. These different perspectives are
complementary, each one adding a piece to the puzzle. For example,
linguistics proposes in-depth descriptions implementing constraints
in order to filter out structures by means of description languages,
constraint ranking, etc. The constraint programming paradigm, on the
other hand, shows that constraints have to be taken as a systematic
whole and can thus play a role in building the structures (or can even
replace structures). Finally, psycholinguistics investigates the role
of constraint systems for cognitive processes in comprehension and
production as well as addressing how they can be acquired.
Invited speakers:
-----------------
2 or 3 distinguished researchers will be announced on the workshop
web pages.
Topics
------
The workshop seeks contributions from different areas working with
constraints in relation to language including, but not limited to the
topics
   . Constraints in human language comprehension and production
   . Context modelling and discourse interpretation
   . Acquisition of constraints
   . Constraints and learning
   . Cross-theoretical view of the notion of constraint
   . New advances in constraint-based linguistic theories
   . Constraint satisfaction (CS) technologies for NLP
   . Linguistic analysis and linguistic theories biased towards CS or
     constraint logic programming (CLP)
   . Application of CS or CLP for NLP
   . CS and CLP for other than textual or spoken languages, e.g.,
       sign languages and biological, multimodal human-computer
       interaction, visual languages,
   . Probabilistic constraint-based reasoning
Submissions
-----------
Authors are invited to submit extended abstract or a full paper of up
to 12 pages. Papers should be prepared as PDF files using the format
for Springer's LNCS/LNAI series,

Dear Willard,
Desmond Schmidt's distinction between the correctness of the program
and the correctness of the model does get close to the heart of the
issues you raise, inasmuch as a program can be wildly wrong, even
when "correct", when the model on which it is based is inadequate.
Writing programs in the classical form you were taught in -- which
we've learned to call the "waterfall model", suggesting everything
just moves along sedately until the moment of implementation, when it
all crashes in at once (but see the link cited below), did seem like
the way to do it in an age where intellectual labor was cheap
relative to computers and the time and expertise required to code
them. Such operations did not (or at least so they thought) have the
luxury of getting it wrong a few times before they got it right.
Perhaps they assumed the difference between "wrong" and "right" to be
clearer than it often is; perhaps they simply assumed that the
modeling problem was relatively straightforward and easy -- as any
committee of intelligent and informed people could do it -- whereas
the implementation in code was hard, required special expertise, and
could only be done by a select few with expensive educations. And
perhaps the sorts of problems they were trying to solve -- mapping
trajectories or calculating payments due -- were easier to model than
the problems we think about ("finding information"). Whatever the
reasons, we now discover the reverse to be more often the case: it's
the specification of what should happen that's the difficult part,
not the making it happen once it's been specified.
Yet while the problems have become harder, the means available for
solving them have become more powerful. So we discover that with
cheap machines, open-source platforms, web-based and self-directed
learning, computer programming does, at length, become more like
composition, in the sense that both become means whereby we can think
with our hands. Just as the writer learns what she thinks by writing
it (and striking it out and rewriting it), the programmer can come to
better understandings of a problem by using the computer as a more
plastic instrument, trying things out -- both in models and in
implementation -- and then scrapping, recasting, refactoring.
Accordingly, both design and implementation can become more
iterative, evolutionary, "spiral", as it's called. This does not
actually bring an end to the old way of doing it, any more than a
writer necessarily spends less time in sentence composition than she
did as a three-year-old child, when sentences were new. It's just
that the waterfall has now become a cascading rapid, development
pouring down through eddies and rivulets, sometimes gathering in calmer pools.
Dare I cite Wikipedia, whose development has also followed a spiral,
and entails both software development and natural language composition?

CALL FOR PAPERS: deadline 15 June 2007
Sustainable Transformations: Technology and Its Environments
Humanities and Technology Association Conference
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, Indiana
October 4-6, 2007
The theme of the 31st Annual Humanities and Technology Conference
reflects the contemporary interest in the multiple interfaces of
technologies and their environments. HTA invites individual papers and
session proposals addressing the conference theme from the viewpoints of
the humanities, the sciences, and engineering.
In addition to the conference theme, papers on all other aspects of the
interactions of technology, science, and the humanities are welcome.
Next to innovations explicitly designed to protect the environment,
modern technology creates new environments and alters existing ones,
both natural and human-made. Whether it be with respect to aging,
privacy, healthcare, education, transportation, or communication, new
technologies keep redefining our environments for us.
This conference (www.rose-hulman.edu/hta2007) invites contributions that
explore, for example:
*developments in environmental technology, as well as the political,
social, and economic challenges they pose;
*the destruction and/or creation through technology of natural, human
made, or virtual environments of all kinds;
*aesthetic and artistic reactions to the destruction or creation of new
environments;
*the sustainability of natural or virtual environments;
*human adaptations to technological environments;
*philosophical and ethical dimensions of technological environments;
*the ecology of environments.
Please submit a one-page proposal (200 words) by June 15, 2007 to:

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 81 (81)

Dear Willard,
I don't disagree with anything Wendell says. However, his response
raises a question about modelling which has been troubling me for some
time. In your book you say "computational models, however finely
perfected, are better understood as temporary structures in a process
of coming to know rather than fixed structures of knowledge." (27) and
later you say: "Eventually we realize that the perpetual impetus to
construct a permanently elusive whole is the point." (188). You thus
appear to see the computational model as a temporary interpretation
that opens out the text, lets us see one aspect, one view through the
dirty glass window of software tools. I think that Wendell would
probably disagree with this picture of computational models - as I
gather from his comments below, where he talks about "right" and
"wrong". I also think that models are pictures of reality, as
Wittgenstein said: "there must be something identical in the picture
and what it depicts, to enable the one to be a picture of the other at
all." (Tractatus 2.161) I thus see models as approximations of reality
that are gradually refined.  This is a scientific point of view.
Humanists like to think that everything is an interpretation, for
example that the tags that we choose to describe a text are an
interpretation. The selection is, but the tags themselves usually
describe facts about a text, e.g. that a word is underlined - what is
interpretative about that? I know there are people who will argue even
with this, but to say that it is ALL interpretation as is so often done
I think misrepresents a more subtle situation. One of the reasons I
suspect you say this about computational models is that the tools for
constructing them are so poor. A compressed view of humanities
computing over the past 40 years would seem to support your
interpretation - after all, is that not what we have all been doing -
creating models and then throwing them away? I am not so pessimistic,
however. I like to think that we can get somewhere, and if the
computational models are bad perhaps we just need to make better ones.
I see models as data structures that are tied to the algorithms that
process the text, like a hand that fits into a glove.

I've worked in a commercial environment for the last five years,
developing a natural language generation system that creates a
narrative of the findings discovered during a doctor's encounter with
a patient.
We have used the Spiral Approach to software development for a number
of reasons.    Probably the  most important one was that there was a
lot of skepticism about my ability to accomplish this task.   So we
started with a "proof of concept" system that generated simple
sentences to prove that we could do it at all.    Then we moved to
the "prototype" stage which gave us more credibility with more
features and better narrative.  Gradually we have continued to expand
and elaborate both the model and the code, using continuous feedback
from our users and the doctors within the company.    In fact we just
two weeks ago started a weekly meeting for the doctors to critique
our output.  The goal is to make the narrative sound as if a doctor
wrote it, which is a noble endeavor, but we're getting closer!
I don't believe the old Waterfall Method would be at all appropriate
in today's world.   In fact, we hear about spectacular failures in
the government, where they've contracted with some company that's
gone off with a set of initial specifications, written a huge system,
and returned with it to discover that it didn't fit the needs of the
organization -- or more likely the needs changed during that
time.   The FBI is a case in point, I believe.   And since such
systems take years to develop, then after the software has failed,
the organization is even farther behind than it was before.
Our system has proven quite robust!   I designed it to be modular, to
change as we added features, so it has been able to adapt to the new
capabilities and larger and larger amounts of data.   There are still
new additions we intend to make over in the future, including
translating the narratives into languages besides English, and so on.
With language generation, there is no end to improvements, just as
one can keep polishing any piece of text to make it better.

Willard,
[deleted quotation]For that matter, how exploratory is composition (e.g., an office memo,
a UN resolution, a love letter, the OED, "the" Boeing 777 maintenance
manual, a response to a mailing list) known to be these days?
Designing software systems is very much like writing in one important
respect - it is a skill (art) that requires a knowledge of the
different techniques involved, and the selection and application of an
appropriate technique based on experience and personal (institutional)
aptitude. Some do it better than others, novices rarely do it best
(though sometimes adequately for their purposes). The ONE RIGHT WAY
approach to software engineering that is taught in school is no more
fixed and final than the ONE RIGHT WAY of composition taught in school
- and the best schools don't teach it that way.
Some (possibly obvious, possibly uninteresting) thoughts on factors
that influence "exploratory programming" follow. . .
A critical factor in picking a software model is the size and the
scope of the project. For small project (about 2 programmers working
for about 2 years or less) the best approach (in my opinion) probably
does look a lot like composition. Do a bit of pre-writing, sketch out
the overall structure of the system, start coding (and testing) and
see what works. Critique the code (and the system design) and rework
things as you go along.
As you get bigger (one might think of systems that involve thousands
of programmers, plus support staff working over decades) you need a
more formal process and much more control. This, of course, is much
like composition as well - I suspect composing a work like the OED or
the Encyclopedia Britanica involves a somewhat different process than
what I learned in high school.
A related question is what degree of correctness must be guaranteed?
If I build a user interface and it is badly wrong, no one will be able
to use the tool. In this case though, I build a new interface and
everyone is happy again (or happier). On the other hand, if I
accidentally delete (or worse, corrupt) the database containing a
decade or so of painstakingly gathered information the problem is much
worse. The same holds true if I design a data model that represents
the information in ways that meet my needs now, but poorly model the
data and hence, has only limited usefulness for future work.
Accordingly, it makes sense to invest much more up-front effort in
making sure the data model part of a system a) doesn't destroy things,
and b) is "correct". The interface components of a system however, are
likely to be best served by a highly exploratory process with frequent
revisions. The waterfall approach would be (has been) a disaster for
interface design. Of course, one lesson that has been learned quite
well of the past 60 years of computer science is that you are NEVER
right the first time (which brings to mind the fact that texts are
really an ordered hierarchy of content objects . . . or something like
that . . . sometimes for some purposes). The best designs will need
revisions and we will always learn things in the process.

programming and design, and an understanding of WWW programming,
including protocols like HTTP and markup languages. Applicants should
have experience with Java, especially servlet programming and XML
processing, SQL, and at least one other language such as C/C++, Ruby,
Python, PHP, or Perl.  Experience with XSLT, MySQL, XML databases,
information retrieval software (especially Lucene) institutional
repository software, Tomcat, metadata standards such as METS and
MODS, and the Text Encoding Initiative will be considered a plus.
Should be comfortable working in Linux and able to administer a Linux
workstation.
A second, similar, position will be advertised soon.  More details
and application procedures are at: <a href="https://s4.its.unc.edu/RAMS4/">https://s4.its.unc.edu/RAMS4/</a>

Dear Humanist colleagues, the discussion about reviewing process is quite on

and now. Am I not correct? I wonder if anyone can help me to calculate it in
the modern way? For example, we have 22 Verbials in Agatha Christie and 8 -
in J.K.
Rowling. Both texts are of the equal size 10 000 words. I calculated the
Chi-square as 6.53. It means that there is a statistical difference between
them at the level of 5%, since the table value is 3.84. I wonder if I

19th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information, Aug. 6-17, 2007
12th Conference on Formal Grammar, Aug 4 & 5, 2007
Postgraduate Student Grants (EACL)
This is a gentle reminder of the June 1 early registration deadline
for the 19th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
and co-located 12th Conference on Formal Grammar.  At the bottom of
this notice is information about six grants made available by the
European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
Please see the ESSLLI website (<a href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007">http://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007</a>) for
the current state of detail and online registration.
The 19th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
(ESSLLI 2007) is organized by the Computational Linguistics Group of
the Department of Computer Science and the Centre for Language and
Communication Studies, Trinity College Dublin, under the auspices of
FoLLI, the European Association for Logic, Language and Information.
The main focus of ESSLLI is the interface between linguistics,
logic and computation. The school has developed into an important
meeting place and forum for students, researchers and IT professionals
interested in the interdisciplinary study of these three fields.
The 19th edition of ESSLLI offers 42 courses, given by leading
scholars, organized into three interdisciplinary areas (Language &
Computation, Language & Logic, Logic & Computation), at a variety of
levels (foundational, introductory, advanced); 6 workshops; and a
Student Session. The 12th Conference on Formal Grammar is a co-located
event.  The course and workshops generally consist of 5 once-a-day 90
minute session.
The dates for Formal Grammar are August 4 and 5, 2007.  ESSLLI
runs August 6-17, 2007.
Foundational courses cover elementary subjects of a foundational
nature. They presuppose no background knowledge, and should be
accessible to people from other disciplines.
Introductory courses are intended to equip students and young
researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic methods and
techniques, and to allow experienced researchers from other fields to
acquire the key competences of neighboring disciplines, thus
encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research
community.
Advanced courses enable participants to acquire more specialized
knowledge about topics they are already familiar with.
The 6 Workshops are intended to encourage collaboration and the
cross-fertilization of ideas by stimulating in-depth discussion of
issues which are at the forefront of current research in the field. In
these workshops, students and researchers can give presentations of
their research.
The Student Session has the aim of providing Masters and PhD students
with an opportunity to present their own work to a professional
audience, thereby getting informed feedback on their own results.
For Workshops and the Student Session, see the web site for further
information and CFPs.
We are pleased to announce the availability of six 500 euro grants to
postgraduate students funded through the generosity of the European
Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.  Applicants
for these grants should supply the following documentation:
   o Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of
the candidate
   o Source and amount of yearly income

Dear Willard,
Desmond Schmidt's distinction between the correctness of the program
and the correctness of the model does get close to the heart of the
issues you raise, inasmuch as a program can be wildly wrong, even
when "correct", when the model on which it is based is inadequate.
Writing programs in the classical form you were taught in -- which
we've learned to call the "waterfall model", suggesting everything
just moves along sedately until the moment of implementation, when it
all crashes in at once (but see the link cited below), did seem like
the way to do it in an age where intellectual labor was cheap
relative to computers and the time and expertise required to code
them. Such operations did not (or at least so they thought) have the
luxury of getting it wrong a few times before they got it right.
Perhaps they assumed the difference between "wrong" and "right" to be
clearer than it often is; perhaps they simply assumed that the
modeling problem was relatively straightforward and easy -- as any
committee of intelligent and informed people could do it -- whereas
the implementation in code was hard, required special expertise, and
could only be done by a select few with expensive educations. And
perhaps the sorts of problems they were trying to solve -- mapping
trajectories or calculating payments due -- were easier to model than
the problems we think about ("finding information"). Whatever the
reasons, we now discover the reverse to be more often the case: it's
the specification of what should happen that's the difficult part,
not the making it happen once it's been specified.
Yet while the problems have become harder, the means available for
solving them have become more powerful. So we discover that with
cheap machines, open-source platforms, web-based and self-directed
learning, computer programming does, at length, become more like
composition, in the sense that both become means whereby we can think
with our hands. Just as the writer learns what she thinks by writing
it (and striking it out and rewriting it), the programmer can come to
better understandings of a problem by using the computer as a more
plastic instrument, trying things out -- both in models and in
implementation -- and then scrapping, recasting, refactoring.
Accordingly, both design and implementation can become more
iterative, evolutionary, "spiral", as it's called. This does not
actually bring an end to the old way of doing it, any more than a
writer necessarily spends less time in sentence composition than she
did as a three-year-old child, when sentences were new. It's just
that the waterfall has now become a cascading rapid, development
pouring down through eddies and rivulets, sometimes gathering in calmer pools.
Dare I cite Wikipedia, whose development has also followed a spiral,
and entails both software development and natural language composition?

What:   International Workshop on Markup of Overlapping Structures
          XML and SGML have revolutionized the representation of
          structured information, but not all information structures
          map
          easily into systems of hierarchically nested elements. Markup
          of overlapping structures is a perennially hot topic,
          reinvented and reimagined as often as it is solved.
          This full-day workshop will bring together the proponents of
          some of the major proposals for markup, representation,
          extraction, display, and validation of semantic overlap to
          summarize the systems they are developing and discuss topics
          of common interest. A morning of formal presentations will be
          followed by an afternoon of free-ranging discussion.

Dear Humanist colleagues, nobody answered how to calculate the
Chi-square in the modern way. So, I think that the old way is quite
all right. I mean the reviewer who claimed to know the modern way was
joking. Actually, do you know how to compare two numbers with the
help of the Sign Test? Can you exactly tell me about two numbers 76
and 48 ? The Chi-square gives 6.30 which is greater 3.84 at the level
of 0.05. It means these two numbers are statistically different. What
about the Sign Test in this case? Please, teach me to calculate it.

Date: Tue, 28 Nov 2006 08:14:28 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 99 (99)

Dear colleagues,
Years ago I read a psychometric study of how people use computing
systems as a function of the time between a user-initiated action and
the system's response. The conclusion of the study was that if more
than ca 1.5 seconds elapsed, the delay would begin to affect what the
user then did. For example, this study suggested, if I put a query to
a system and more than the threshold delay occurs, then I will begin
to censor subsequent queries based on some assessment or other that I
make of the probability of a useful response. The conclusion seems
quite plausible. Consider, for example, unavoidable delays in
conversation between saying something and getting a response. Spontaneity goes.
My question is, can anyone here give me a reference to this or any
similar study?
Many thanks.
Yours,
WM

[deleted quotation]Howdy,
Of course, without knowing the full details of the article, one can
only speculate on what the reviewer had in mind.  The digested version
of what was done in the paper in question was checking the relative
distribution of one linguistic feature between two sources.  It is
possible that the reviewer was objecting to the articulation of the
null hypothesis  (that any differences in the distributions are random)
or the alternative hypothesis (that the two texts could not have been
drawn from the same population).  One or other of those might have
been given a different interpretation.  Further, the fact that the
null hypotheses was rejected might have been used to argue support
for a hypothesis far more general than the test was actually focused
upon.
There's a very interesting article about the use of Chi-square testing
in natural language research by Adam Kilgarriff:

1.  Using Chi-squared in cases where it isn't appropriate (non-exclusive
categories, too few observations, time-influenced data etc.)
2.  Using Chi-squared after failing to follow appropriate observational &
descriptive analysis.
3.  Using Chi-squared when a parametric test (t-test, ANOVA) would do just as
well.
The first two just involve proper scientific procedure and analysis, and is not
unique to Chi-squared.   Of course, just popping data into SPSS and running a
test is not a good way to go about any statistical analysis.
The last one is bit of statistical snobbery, but it is valid enough
to warrant a
mention.   If the parametric test can be run, you should run it instead of the
Chi-squared (despite any preference for Greek letters).   (see this tutorial
for an explanation:
<a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/ballc/webtools/web_chi_tut.html">http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/ballc/webtools/web_chi_tut.html</a> ).
The whole thing about the "new" way to run a Chi-squared confounds me, although
I'd need a context for the quote.   Mathematical distributions are not very
useful if they change over time.   If a more proficient or flexible
distribution is discovered, I am sure they'd give it a new name to make note of
that fact.  Frankly, I can only see this happening for specific kinds of
Chi-tests, and the Chi test would still be relevant because it is so easy to
use.
Sometimes economists will give the use a series of procedures a name
and call it
a "test" -- for instance, the Granger test uses Least-squares regression and
ANOVA on time-series data -- but now I'm really grasping.
Sometimes another test is required to make sure the data is appropriate for a
particular statistical test.   But Chi-squared is so basic that I cannot really
think of case where that is necessary.   (Still grasping).
Hope this is helpful.
For transparency sake, I am a diletant on statistical matters (ie. geeky enough
to write about it on a wiki).  Judging on my not-so-many years of statistical
memory, I encourage further comments to straighten anything I've said out.

TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGE IN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE
"Even if research shows that a particular technology supports a certain
kind of learning, this research may not reveal the implications of
implementing it. Without appropriate infrastructure or adequate
provisions of services (policy); without the facility or ability of
teachers to integrate it into their teaching practice (academics);
without sufficient support from technologists and/or educational
technologists (support staff), the likelihood of the particular
technology or software being educationally effective is questionable."
The current issue (vol. 19, no. 1, 2007) of the JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL
TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY presents a selection of papers from the Conference
Technology and Change in Educational Practice which was held at the
London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, London in October 2005.
The papers cover three areas: "methodological frameworks, proposing new
ways of structuring effective research; empirical studies, illustrating
the ways in which technology impacts the working roles and practices in
Higher Education; and new ways of conceptualising technologies for
education."
Papers include:
"A Framework for Conceptualising the Impact of Technology on Teaching
        and Learning" by Sara Price and Martin Oliver, London Knowledge

EMAIL: TOO MUCH OR NOT A BOTHER?
A couple of recent articles discuss people's aggravation with the
masses of email that they receive and how they are curtailing or
eliminating it altogether:
"The supposed convenience of electronic mail, like so many other
innovations of technology, has become too much for some people. . . .
So some say they're moving back to the telephone as their preferred
means of communication." ("E-Mail Reply to All: 'Leave Me Alone'" by
Mike Musgrove, THE WASHINGTON POST, May 25, 2007, pg. A01;
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/24/AR2007052402258.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/24/AR2007052402258.html</a>)
"More university professors are joining the ranks of those who have
given up or severely curtailed their use of e-mail as a medium for
personal -- and most of all -- private correspondence. They have had
enough with electronic spam, come-ons, nonsense and smut-vertisements"
(Paul McCloskey, "Academics Joining Ranks Declaring 'E-Mail
Bankruptcy'," CAMPUS TECHNOLOGY, May 29, 2007;
<a href="http://www.campustechnology.com/article.aspx?aid=48289">http://www.campustechnology.com/article.aspx?aid=48289</a>).
        
Conversely, "Spam 2007," a Pew Internet & American Life Project paper
released this month, reports that "37% of email users said spam had
increased in their personal email accounts, up from 28% of email users
who said that two years ago. And 29% of work email users said spam had
increased in their work email accounts, up from 21% two years ago. Yet
fewer people say spam is 'a big problem' for them."

HELP DIGITIZE BOOKS FROM YOUR DESKTOP
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is used to transform
scanned book pages into searchable text. However, the accuracy of this
method is dependent on the clarity of the characters being scanned.
Fuzzy or indistinct printed texts are not always rendered correctly.
Human proofreading of scanned texts can correct OCR errors, but it is
labor-intensive and expensive. "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University have discovered a way to enlist people across the globe to
help digitize books every time they solve the simple distorted word
puzzles commonly used to register at Web sites or buy things online.
The word puzzles are known as CAPTCHAs, short for 'completely automated
public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart.' Computers
cannot decipher the twisted letters and numbers, ensuring that real
people and not automated programs are using the Web sites." (Associated
Press, May 24, 2007)
According to the project website, "Each new word that cannot be read
correctly by OCR is given to a user in conjunction with another word
for which the answer is already known. The user is then asked to read
both words. If they solve the one for which the answer is known, the
system assumes their answer is correct for the new one. The system then
gives the new image to a number of other people to determine, with
higher confidence, whether the original answer was correct." The
results are then used to correct the word in the scanned texts.

Ubiquity associate editor A. Triptahi writes of it: "Prophetically,
almost thirty years ago Jean-Francois Lyotard forecast the end of the
modern research university based on Enlightenment principles. He
envisaged the emergence of technical institutes in the service of the
information-rich global multinationals. This book reflects on the
post-war Western university and its discourses charting the crisis of
the concept of the modern university. First, it examines the university
within a global networked economy; second, it adopts poststructuralist
perspectives in epistemology, politics and ethics to appraise the role
of the contemporary university; third, it introduces the notion of
'development' in a critical fashion as a way of explaining its
potentially new regional and international learning roles; fourth, it
analyzes the rise of global science and the disciplines in the context
of the global economy; and, finally, it raises Lyotard's 'logic of
performativity' and the assessment of research quality within a
neoliberal economy, linking it firmly to the question of freedom and
the republic of science."

I would like to endorse the position on agile methods put forward by

the table throughout the process. Sometimes it is possible to think
of design, whether visual communication design or sometimes also
information design and visualization, as a polishing stage at the end
of the process, but the interactions between designers and
programmers are often fruitful, and the ideas and decisions of both
groups can benefit from knowing what the others are about at each stage.

On a walk the other day, here at Digital Humanities 2007, Stefan
Sinclair raised a couple of questions worth much wider circulation
than just around inside my brain. The first was in effect the degree
to which we need to be practical when framing our research questions.
If a question cannot be approached at all, given the current state of
knowledge, is it worth the candle? The second one was, if one is
investigating something not subject to proof, how much confidence can
one place in the results one gets? In other words, what is the court
of last resort? Oneself? A reasonably large sampling of specialists
in the area of research?
The first question had to do with some ideas I have about where to go
with my own work. I agreed with him, that as far as I could see, no
technology suits the problem I have. Let's say that we're both right
about this. (I hope we are not.) What justification should I give
myself for spending my most precious coin, time looking upon the
light, to pursue ideas that cannot be implemented? Ok, I know the
response of the liberal-arts-college-trained intellectual like me --
that the totally unknown, coming at us with no guarantees whatever,
is the gold of the humanities. So-called "pure" research, or "wicked"
problems, or whatever we call this sort of thing. But what is the
value of such a response to someone whose passion is designing
processes and building them to work?
The second one haunts us all, I suspect. One colleague recently
proposed of one particular kind of work that it would be validated
when courts of law began using it. In other words, if society at
large takes something on, then it's good. (But how long does one have
to wait? How much longer than Socrates waited?) My response to Stefan
was that the individual researcher was the court of last resort. If
he or she found that using what I had in mind brought clearer
thoughts about the material in question (judged by that individual),
and provided stronger challenges to his or her way of thinking (here
considerable honesty is required), then the tool or approach would be
validated.

Subject: chasing themes vs finding structures
Date: Tue, 05 Jun 2007 13:00:39 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 113 (113)

In his keynote speech to the Digital Humanities conference, Franco
Moretti (English & Comparative Literature, Stanford) said in passing
that until humanities computing can get beyond a preoccupation with
chasing themes in literary works to developing the ability to deal
with their formal properties, it will have very little influence on
literary studies. He did qualify his remark by saying that his
knowledge of humanities computing is limited, but the challenge
stands nevertheless.
My reply to him was twofold: first, that chasing themes is so much
easier than dealing with formal properties in literature that one is
bound to find at this stage in our development much more of it;
second, that people who take an interest in computing from the
various disciplinary heartlands, like him but perhaps not him, tend
to reach for what serves their conventional ways of work without
disturbing these ways. So the actual impediment to greater influence
is not merely that we yet to grow up but that our colleagues in other
disciplines are stuck in their old ways. Is this a fair reply?
Moretti's own use of computing, insofar as this was visible in the
lecture, was confined to the use of spreadsheet graphing to
illustrate formal trends in the novel. But how does computing itself
become concerned with formal properties in literature (or in any
other cultural mode of expression)? Markup can *describe* static
formal properties that we perceive. So can a relational database
design. But isn't this like approaching the study of living systems
(past or present) only by describing their anatomy, their skeletal
structures, their fossilized remains? And since for literary
questions at least this involves significant interpretation every
step of the way, what good is it for anyone other than the person
describing the artefact in question?

Filtered Wisdom
--Judith Axler Turner
Edith Wharton once said something about wisdom
needing to be filtered through personal
experience. In this issue of JEP our authors
bring personal experience to their work, sharing
their interests as well as their scholarship. It
is this personal view that makes this issue of
JEP special. It is also telling that this
collection of articles, which came to JEP one at
a time, spell out a similar theme: publishing is
inexorably moving away from its old paradigms, to
new models where electronic will soon overtake
paper. Even the last bastion--human resistance to
change--is crumbling at the edges and the center cannot long hold.
Hilary Wilder and Sharmila Pixy Ferris wrote an
article for JEP a year ago on communication. They
collaborated using a wiki, a Web space that
allows anyone to read and edit its contents. In
Using a Wiki to Write About Wikis they let JEP
readers know what it was like to write so publicly.

Stefan Sinclair raised a couple of questions worth much wider circulation

In investigating questions the scientific method  works well with
everything but beliefs. How does one measure a persons feelings,
beliefs, knowledge or experiences.  And how does one know that he
really feels that way or not.  If it can be measured  and
repeated.  If it can't then it's belief.
I believe that there are some questions which can never be answered
at all at the present time or even in the near future.  I have hope
that some day all my questions will have answers.  So I would say
that the amount of time one devotes to a problem is of course
dependent on the amount of time one has and is willing to devote to
that question.  And the progress one is making.  Often I have found
myself finding that I have changed my perspective as I have gotten
older and had more experiences.
One has to know what the experts in a particular area think in order
to agree or to disagree with them. However I have found that
sometimes a persons training makes a person blind to alternative ways
of examining problems. So I would say that the only one you really
have to comvince is yourself.  Though it is nice to have others
around you rather than standing up alone exposed to the world.

That is to say that while a solution to a "wicked" problem may prove
elusive, it doesn't mean that other discoveries will not be made
along the way that may result in "designing processes and building
them to work."
Personally I think that work on such problems and designing working
processes should inform each other. For the working process
researcher, they may become aware of limitations of the current art
that are simply accepted. A deeper understanding of current art of
processing may lead theorists to other paths to explore in searching
for solutions.
[deleted quotation]For expert evidence, courts rely upon a consensus of those working in
a particular field. If your definition of "validation" is a consensus
of people working in a field that works fairly well.
While my sympathies lie with your position of the researcher being
the court of last resort, I would not claim to consult a psychic
about the vaidity of an XML schema as opposed to using an appropriate
parser. There are boundaries, set by social convention of those
working in a field that delimit "valid" approaches from those that
are thought to be invalid. And those change over time. Instructive in
this regard is Fish's essay, "Transmuting the Lump: Paradise Lost, 1942-1979."
Fish traces the interpertation of books XI and XII of Paradise Lost
to illustrate how the accepted interpertation of that work changed
over time. I suspect the same is true of the methodogies that we
apply to problems.
Hope you are at the start of a great week!

finding structures?
Hi,
I missed last night's keynote, but I find Willard's summary of the
highlight below very provocative. With the understanding that I am
responding to the message below and not the talk itself, I would have
to say that the response strikes me as valid for the reason that DH
encompasses many disciplines some of which do not rely on thematic
analyses as much as we, in literatures, do.
My own sense, reflected in my presentation (I apologise for the plug)is
is that we need to start placing greater emphasis on the processes on
which work in the various DH discipines depends, rather than contiue
the traditional emphasis on content. The emphasis on process is made
easier, I think, by the new medium, but I am using this statment inh a
convceptual, symbolic sense as well as a formal one. Making the study
processes focal to each discipline  would probably reveal that most
study and research in the humanities depends on similar processes (that
is, for example, on revealing and learning how interconnectivity and
transfer among various concepts, methods, approaches, interpretation is
achieved in each discipline).
I am not entirely sure what Moretti meant by form, but thininking in
terms of process and content may roughly correspond to the suggested
division between form and theme, but with a wider application.
   I am not working with statistical analyses or markup, so I am sure
that these remarks leave many questions unanswered, such as a very
basic one, which is do we need the digital for what I am suggestiung? I
guess I believe that the computer and the activities it enables are
more capable of facilitating the shift than any other traditional
medium, and that the "how" is worth further investigation....
Best,
Tatjana

elsewhere in today's batch of Humanist, is the following exchange
between an interviewer and Peter Denning, whose writings on computer
science are well worth reading:
[deleted quotation]Some (such as Michael Mahoney) would point out that the term
"science" has several different meanings, i.e. that there are many
sciences, but let's let that point go for now. Whatever it is (or,
better, they are), Denning identifies these reasons for CS being one:
(1) credibility
(2) rationale
(3) interconnections with other fields of enquiry (his 3 & 4)
We've been struggling with the same basic needs. (Note that
credibility is not the same thing as popularity, nor is acceptance
for reasons of usefulness.) A few of us have been working on (2) by
tirelessly, and perhaps tiresomely, attempting to articulate what
humanities computing is. But now, it seems to me, the important thing
is (3), because getting it right will lead to satisfactory resolution
of the other two. CS achieves its interconnections by the fact that
all the sciences have developed computational sub-varieties. Thus,
for example, as a physicist said to me recently, there are three
kinds of physics now, theoretical, experimental and computational.
Perhaps we're going to see the development of similar sub-varieties
in each of the humanities. (Before anyone drags out that truly
tiresome quasi-Marxist argument about the withering away of
humanities computing, note that the vigour of the computational
sciences has not caused CS to wither!)
But what is our principle(s) of interconnection with the disciplines?
Is it (they) not ways or styles of reasoning?

-----
The workshop ``Methods for Modalities'' (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
and tools based on modal logics. Here the term ``modal logics'' is
conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.
To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a
number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations
aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions of
system demonstrations.
We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers
and posters, especially for experimental and prototypical software tools
which are related to modal logics.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 124 (124)

Willard,
I am interested in hearing responses from the list regarding the so-called
"semantic web" and its related buzzword "metaweb" and "Web 3.0."
If I may try to precis the acronym-laden wikipedia article, Semantic Web refers
to the design of rich information sites by exploiting web 2.0/social web
services.
A popular example of this is Freebase (www.freebase.com) which is attempting to
cross-link all sorts of data from around the world using social softwares such
as Wikipedia.
There are a few recent tech developments that has me thinking about
the semantic
web as a discussion piece for Humanist.
1.  Screen monitors that fold like paper:
<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0108/p14s01-stct.html">http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0108/p14s01-stct.html</a>
2.  Microsoft's "surface computer":
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttgx9ygMXz8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttgx9ygMXz8</a>
3.  Photosynth technology:
<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129</a>
Take these three technologies and add them to a "freebase-ish" datasource and
you could conceivably have a mind-blowing experience.
Imagine, if you will, a paper-based product that uses a multi-touch
interface.  You could have an electronic device that works pretty
much like a book with the
ability to "turn pages" with the fingers and re-size the screen to suit vision
preferences.
Using the photosynth technology, you could make a large number of
text resources
available in a small page.   But it could be more than that.   Imagine a
footnote in a work that is, in fact, also a microscopic copy of the entire work
being cited (highlighting the quoted or referred to text of course).
Wikipedia articles could be included to help with word definitions and basic
context for historical references in a work.   And (to take the Notre Dame
example from the Photosynth video), someone could have a virtual tour of the
Notre Dame Cathedral to go along with Hugo's story about the Hunchback.
These ideas are nothing short of what has been projected for the future
thousands of times before, but the development of these technologies appears to
be making them that much closer to a reality.   Also, the "how" and the "why"
of the ideas are far more intricate and (I hope) interesting.
Of course, I would like to leave the intricate part to your readers.  :)
Sincerely,

affects ICT research and development culture
Dear Humanist List,
I just wanted to thank everyone on this list who filled out my
previous survey request.  Your responses have definitely added to
this research.
This will be my last post concerning this research survey, because it
will be up until the end of August for those who might have some
extra time over the next few months to respond, especially if you
could not previously during the original release:
<a href="https://www.runner.ryerson.ca/PRSurvey/survey.cfm">https://www.runner.ryerson.ca/PRSurvey/survey.cfm</a>
I've reproduced the original call below for anyone new to the list,
if you would like more information on this project.  I'll also be
attending the Digital Humanities Summer Institute in Victoria next
week, and I would appreciate setting up 15 minute interviews with
anyone on this list who is attending the institute and has interest
in the project.  If you have time and interest, please e-mail me off
list at: pryan_at_ryerson.ca
Please accept my apologies for cross posting if you've seen this
survey elsewhere.
Thank you for your consideration of this message.
Sincerely,

*********
Original Survey Post:
I was previously referred to this list as a possible source for
survey respondents concerning the following topic: How literary
fiction affects ICT research and development culture.
The scope of this research concerns North America, but I encourage
people from around the globe to respond if they are interested in the
topic.  The brief contact survey can be found at the following URL,
and it will take approximately 15 minutes of your time, depending on
your level of participation:
<a href="https://www.runner.ryerson.ca/PRSurvey/survey.cfm">https://www.runner.ryerson.ca/PRSurvey/survey.cfm</a>
I would appreciate your time in filling out the survey because this
is a part of my doctoral research project.  If you would like more
background on my research, I also have a blog at the following URL:
<a href="http://prnetworks.blogspot.com">http://prnetworks.blogspot.com</a>
*Please take the time to fill the survey out, especially if you are
either 1) a published author of literary fiction, or 2) employed in
the information communication technology sector. The survey should
take about 15 minutes of your time, depending on your level of
involvement.  I appreciate any and all comments and feedback.  The
information recorded will help both quantitative and qualitative
research analysis in the long run.
*Importance of this Research*
I hope that you will take the time to help because of its importance
in the following listed areas of study. Specifically, this research
aims to develop:
1)      a better understanding of how to improve the potential of
networked research via the use of computers. Computers have been called the
"imagination machine", but are we using our new abundance of
information effectively and imaginatively?
2)      an interdisciplinary understanding of how the "two cultures"
of the Arts and the Sciences do in fact work together (if they do at all).
3)      recommendations for economic policy that is being led by the
creative sector. In particular, funding for the Arts has been cut in recent
years, despite the huge economic impact that the cultural industries
have on local economies; however, the funding for ICT R&D continues
to increase without any apparent regard for the environmental
problems caused by the development of the infrastructure that is
required by a technological society -- how can these two policy arcs
be realigned in a focused and mutually beneficial way?
4)      maps of ICT networks that emphasize and link these two
cultures.  If we can visualize how research networks overlap with
artistic and literary capital, then perhaps improvements can be made
to the systems of communication between the agents of these two
cultures. Such an analysis can also be used as a valuable case study
for other communities.
Lastly, I would gladly ask that you forward on my e-mail address and
survey if you know of any other listservs or research networks that
might find this project of interest.  At this point, I hope that the
survey will travel far and wide like a stolen garden gnome taken
around the world that will one day come back to its owner.
Thank you for your time and kind consideration of this message.
Sincerely,
Peter Ryan

Willard,
I am interested in hearing responses from the list regarding the so-called
"semantic web" and its related buzzword "metaweb" and "Web 3.0."
If I may try to precis the acronym-laden wikipedia article, Semantic Web refers
to the design of rich information sites by exploiting web 2.0/social web
services.
A popular example of this is Freebase (www.freebase.com) which is attempting to
cross-link all sorts of data from around the world using social softwares such
as Wikipedia.
There are a few recent tech developments that has me thinking about
the semantic
web as a discussion piece for Humanist.
1.  Screen monitors that fold like paper:
<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0108/p14s01-stct.html">http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0108/p14s01-stct.html</a>
2.  Microsoft's "surface computer":
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttgx9ygMXz8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttgx9ygMXz8</a>
3.  Photosynth technology:
<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129</a>
Take these three technologies and add them to a "freebase-ish" datasource and
you could conceivably have a mind-blowing experience.
Imagine, if you will, a paper-based product that uses a multi-touch
interface.  You could have an electronic device that works pretty
much like a book with the
ability to "turn pages" with the fingers and re-size the screen to suit vision
preferences.
Using the photosynth technology, you could make a large number of
text resources
available in a small page.   But it could be more than that.   Imagine a
footnote in a work that is, in fact, also a microscopic copy of the entire work
being cited (highlighting the quoted or referred to text of course).
Wikipedia articles could be included to help with word definitions and basic
context for historical references in a work.   And (to take the Notre Dame
example from the Photosynth video), someone could have a virtual tour of the
Notre Dame Cathedral to go along with Hugo's story about the Hunchback.
These ideas are nothing short of what has been projected for the future
thousands of times before, but the development of these technologies appears to
be making them that much closer to a reality.   Also, the "how" and the "why"
of the ideas are far more intricate and (I hope) interesting.
Of course, I would like to leave the intricate part to your readers.  :)
Sincerely,
Ryan Deschamps BA (English) MLIS, MPA

I think Ryan has missed the point of the semantic web.   While the
technologies he mentions could be used well in Humanities Computing,
I don't see any connection to the semantic web.   It is a software
approach, not hardware.   It would be more appropriate to think of it
as an extension of the existing markup languages, esp. XML, with a
lot of extra bells and whistles.
Here's the overview of the article in Wikipedia:
     The *semantic web* is an evolving extension of the World Wide Web
     <<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web</a>> in which web content

     in natural language <<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language</a>>,

     <<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web#_note-3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web#_note-3</a>> Other elements

Once upon a time there was a country gentleman, who lived in a big
manor house surrounded by spacious grounds with all manner of
pleasant features. This house had a large domestic staff, which, jobs
being quite scarce, performed every service he demanded. His head
butler saw to that. The head butler kept the grumbling below stairs,
sent the occasional troublemaker packing and so on -- like the
character played by Helen Mirren in Robert Altman's Gosford Park, the
perfect servant, with no life of his own. Our gentleman was very
conservative politically, but he was not completely stupified by the
privileges of birth and the social isolation this often
brings. He knew times were a-changing, and so he invited rather
left-leaning intellectuals to his parties and gatherings from time to
time, so that he could learn from them and maintain his distinguished
role among his peers -- as a bit adventurous and youthful in his
inclinations. On more than one occasion, at one of his gatherings, a
particularly eloquent leftist intellectual would argue with him on
the subject of servitude. Generally the argument would present the
case for allowing the more capable among the servants to become
socially equal members of a collaborative society, in which he would
be a first among equals. These intellectuals were not utopians, for
they had experienced such a society in action, far away in a foreign
country where conditions were rather different. They knew what such a
society could do. Wonderful things. They had proof of this. Although
our gentleman never had an adequate comeback to the revolutionary
arguments, or at least did not present any to said leftists, he could
not bring himself to make changes. He could see that were he to act
as recommended he would be a leader among his peers, perhaps even be
better prepared for longer-term social changes. "But", he reasoned to
himself, "I'm comfortable as I am. I call for what I want, and it
comes. All the powerful people of my world respect me. Why upset a
good situation? Why make work for myself?" On their side, the leftist
guests, time after time, went away, back to their more egalitarian
world, muttering among themselves about wasting their time with this fellow.
In a comforting fable our gentleman would undergo a change of heart,
or come to a sticky end, in either case serving as a moral to the
tale. Let us leave it, however, where it is and so invite some
pondering on the situation. Any recommendations?
Yours,

Many thanks for the response surrounding the "semantic web."   I
think I need to
stage a small defense of my take on the semantic web versus the definition
stated on Wikipedia.
Mary Dee Harris wrote:

I think that hardware provides the environment for software to do its fancy
stuff.  Thus, without innovations in hardware, the semantic web is not
possible.   A good illustration of this is the connection between the mouse and
object-oriented programming.   I would need a historian to clarify which
chicken came before what egg, but the semantic link between "an object" and the
"click and point" interfacing enabled by the mouse is fairly important.   When
you have instruction based interfacing ala DOS or Unix, process (the stages of
actions) become important.   When you interface by pointing at something, then
the items being manipulated become emphasized (thus object-oriented
programming).
Assuming the multi-touch screen works the way Microsoft dreams it does (I still
haven't seen it in action, nor have I seen much more than the ability to move
pictures around a screen), there are apt to be changes in the way we think
about our software.   For one, the choosing of an object and the manipulation
of that object are simultaneous occurrences.   An immediate impact would be on
something like AJAX, where interfacing would require the addition of rotations,
resizing, distortions etc. to make the data make the kind of sense that the
hardware is insisting it make.
There is no doubt that XML and other standards will facilitate the semantic web
but I would say the wikipedia article is largely unfinished (and likely being
"worked on" by people connected to data standards in ways that the layperson is
not -- there is a whole other discussion about this for another email, though).
I would make the analogy that http protocol makes the internet possible, but
http protocol is not the "web."   The web does not exist unless there are
people using the protocol and connecting their servers to lines in ways that
make the web possible.    In the same vein, I would say the semantic web is not
XML with bells and whistles, but masses of people using XML in ways to help
computers make connections that would have previously required awareness by a
human.  Watching a computer recognize that an object sitting on it is a digital
camera is one example of this vision.

CALL FOR PAPERS
EVIDENCE OF READING, READING THE EVIDENCE
A major international conference to be held at
the Institute of English Studies, University of
London
   21-23 July 2008
Organised by the Open University and the Institute of English Studies
Keynote speakers: Kate Flint, Jonathan Rose, David Vincent
Studies centred on the history of reading have
proliferated in the last twenty years. They have
sprung from several different disciplines,
encompassed different periods and geographical
locations and chosen divergent methodologies, but
their common quest has been to recover and
understand the traces of a practice which is
central to our understanding of human history, yet
notoriously elusive.
One such approach is "The Reading Experience
Database 1450-1945" (RED), a project run by the
Open University and the University of London.
While RED is already proving its worth as a digital
resource, its methodological parameters are
necessarily limited and its vision therefore partial.
What is needed in order for the study of the
history of reading to progress beyond the boundaries
of specific institutions, disciplines,
methodologies, geographical locations and time periods is a
forum in which as many diverse approaches as
possible are brought into energetic debate.
This major 3-day conference, the first of its
type, seeks to provide such a forum. We invite 20-
minute papers from international students and
scholars of any discipline - both within and outside
the Humanities =AD who are interested in the
history and practice of reading in any period or
geographical location. Topics may include, but are by no means limited to:
_ Theories of reading				_ Issues of literacy
_ National and transnational histories	_ Reading and readers in fiction
_ Reading communities			_ Quantitative versus qualitative methodologies
_ Genre reading				_ Digital resources and their development
_ Visual representations of reading		_ Reading across disciplines/languages
_ Using historical data in contemporary research fields
_ The sociology, psychology and neurology of reading experiences
_ Evidence of reading from private audio recordings and blogs
_ Finding, compiling, interpreting and preserving the evidence of reading
Paper titles, abstracts of no more than 300 words
and short biographies should be sent
electronically by 31 January 2008 to all three organisers: Dr Shaf Towheed
(S.S.Towheed_at_open.ac.uk); Dr Rosalind Crone
(r.h.crone_at_open.ac.uk); Dr Katie Halsey
(Katie.Halsey_at_sas.ac.uk).

CHArt TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL CONFERENCE
London Venue to be confirmed
Thursday 8 - Friday 9 November 2007
- FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS -
Museums, galleries, archives, libraries and media organisations such
as publishers and film and broadcast companies, have traditionally
mediated and controlled access to cultural resources and knowledge.
What is the future of such 'top-down' institutions in the age of
'bottom-up' access to knowledge and cultural artifacts through what
is generally known as Web 2:0 - encompassing YouTube, Bittorrent,
Napster, Wikipedia, Google, MySpace and more. Will such institutions
respond to this threat to their cultural hegemony by resistance or
adaptation? How can a museum or a gallery or, for that matter, a
broadcasting company, appeal to an audience which has unprecedented
access to cultural resources? How can institutions predicated on a
cultural economy of scarcity compete in an emerging state of cultural
abundance?
For the twenty-third CHArt conference we are looking for papers that
reflect upon these issues, particularly in relation to visual
culture. We particularly welcome contributions from those working in
either 'traditional' cultural organisations or those involved in new
forms of cultural access and distribution.
We welcome contributions from all sections  of the CHArt community:
Art Practice; Art History; Museums; Galleries; Curation; Archives;
Libraries; Education; Media and Broadcast Production; Cultural Assets
Management and Access; Hardware; Software; Theory.
Please email submissions (a three hundred word synopsis of the
proposed paper with brief CV of presenter/s and other key figures) by
30 June 2007 to Hazel Gardiner
(<mailto:hazel.gardiner_at_kcl.ac.uk>hazel.gardiner_at_kcl.ac.uk).
CHArt is delighted to be able to confirm that a limited number of
bursaries are available (supported by the AHRC ICT Methods Network)
for Post Graduate students presenting papers.  For further
information about CHArt bursaries, please contact Hazel Gardiner.

UBIQUITY ALERT: A NEW INTERVIEW WITH PETER
DENNING ON THE GREAT PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTING.
       Associate Editor Gutam Kuman Saha describes
the general outline of a scheme for tolerating
various operational faults during processing or
during execution of an application through error
detection and tolerating memory and register bit
errors. He says, "An application system can be
made a robust one with this software approach by
establishing transient fault tolerance at a very
low cost. We do not intend to tolerate software
design bugs here. Rather we aim to tolerate any
kind of fault that might appear due to
environmental changes during the program execution time."

and Humanities
*Press release*
*Supporting research in the Arts and Humanities: JISC to review its
services*
13 June 2007. Following the decision by the AHRC (Arts and Humanities
Research Council) to cease funding the AHDS <<a href="http://www.ahds.ac.uk/">http://www.ahds.ac.uk/</a>>
(Arts and Humanities Data Service) from March 31st 2008, JISC has
decided that it is unable to fund the service alone and that therefore
its own funding of the service will, in its current form, cease on the
same date.
In its 11 years of existence the AHDS has established itself as a centre
of expertise and excellence in the creation, curation and preservation
of digital resources and has been responsible for a considerable
engagement of the Arts and Humanities community with ICT and  a
significant increase in that community's knowledge and use of digital
resources. Its contribution to the development of technical standards,
its outreach to sectors beyond higher education, such as cultural
heritage, arts, museum and archive organisations and its support for the
development of a national e-infrastructure and repository system have
been among its many significant achievements.
In the light of these achievements and the consequent risks to the
continued development of the Arts ands Humanities community's engagement
with ICT, JISC is exploring with the AHDS, partner organisations and the
wider community alternative approaches to maintaining its strong support
for that community beyond March 2008.
JISC has a long history of support for Arts and Humanities research,
beginning with the founding of the AHDS in 1996 and continuing with its
collaboration with the AHRC over the ICT Methods Network
<<a href="http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/">http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/</a>>, the Arts and Humanities e-Science
initiative
<<a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/apply/research/sfi/ahrcsi/ahrc-epsrc-jisc_arts_humanities_e-science_initiative.asp">http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/apply/research/sfi/ahrcsi/ahrc-epsrc-jisc_arts_humanities_e-science_initiative.asp</a>>
(with the AHRC and EPSRC), its contribution to the wider e-Science
Initiative <<a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/escience/default.htm">http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/escience/default.htm</a>>, and in
particular the Research Grants and Studentships Scheme
<<a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/apply/research/sfi/ahrcsi/ahrc-epsrc-jisc_arts_humanities_e-science_initiative.asp">http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/apply/research/sfi/ahrcsi/ahrc-epsrc-jisc_arts_humanities_e-science_initiative.asp</a>>
and the Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre
<<a href="http://www.ahessc.ac.uk/">http://www.ahessc.ac.uk/</a>> (AHESSC). JISC's Support of Research
committee has also funded the Aria project
<<a href="http://aria.dmu.ac.uk/whatIs.html">http://aria.dmu.ac.uk/whatIs.html</a>> and a related Projects and Methods
database <<a href="http://ahds.ac.uk/about/projects/pmdb-extension/#details">http://ahds.ac.uk/about/projects/pmdb-extension/#details</a>>
which have now been merged into an integrated resource, the ICT Guides
<<a href="http://ahds.ac.uk/ictguides/">http://ahds.ac.uk/ictguides/</a>>.
At its meeting yesterday, the JISC Board reaffirmed its strong
commitment to continuing this engagement but in the light of wider
developments reluctantly acknowledged that the AHDS as currently
constituted would not be part of its service provision beyond next year.
Chair of JISC, Professor Sir Ron Cooke, paid tribute to the AHDS,
saying: "The AHDS has achieved a great deal in the last 11 years and we
would like to thank its staff for their skill, dedication and hard work
over these years. One of the AHDS's many achievements has been
establishing capacity and expertise within the Arts and Humanities
community. JISC will continue to support that community in its
engagement with ICT in order to meet the many challenges of the future."

Methods and Technologies for Enabling Virtual Research Communities
Monday 18 June 2007 2pm - 4pm
PART 1 The Potential of Access Grid for Collaborative Research in the
Arts and Humanities
David Shepherd, University of Sheffield
Andrew Prescott, University of Wales Lampeter
The Access Grid has been hailed as the 'Miramax of video
conferencing'. However, its use to date by many arts and humanities
researchers has chiefly been restricted to activities which could be
supported by other videoconferencing tools and techniques. Between
October 2006 and March 2007 a project was undertaken, under the
auspices of the AHRC e-science programme, at the Humanities Research
Institute at the University of Sheffield and in collaboration with a
number of other humanities and other computing centres across Britain
and Europe to identify and appraise critically the areas where the
Access Grid could potentially support collaborative research
activities between arts and humanities researchers in four activity
areas: digital images; sound and moving image; electronic texts and
databases; virtual reality and visualisation. An Access Grid workshop
was held for each of these activity areas. This presentation will
review the conclusions of these workshops and suggest future areas of
development for Access Grid use by arts and humanities researchers.
Where appropriate, extracts from recordings of the workshops will be
shown, and prototype software developed in the course of the
workshops will be demonstrated.
PART 2: Agora: Easy to use collaboration software for the Arts and Humanities
Rob Crouchley, Adrian Fish, Miguel Gonzalez, Centre of e-Science,
Lancaster University
Agora is an extremely easy to use online meeting tool, designed from
the ground up with desktop PC and laptop users in mind. Agora
facilitates the spontaneous use of video conferencing from your
office; setting up a conference can be as easy as entering a few
email addresses and clicking one button. Agora can also be integrated
into several popular portal frameworks by simply running an
installer. Agora has been designed to avoid many of the typical
problems involved in configuring similar environments, environments
where complexity and expensive equipment are a given, and skilled
administrators are essential. Despite its simplicity and ease of use,
Agora has all the features necessary for a rich e-collaboration
experience. Our talk will highlight the key features of Agora and how
these features can be used to greatly enhance research interaction
carried out by geographically dispersed teams. We will illustrate
Agora's usefulness with some use cases from the Arts and Humanities.
The talk will be primarily aimed at the researcher although there
will be a degree of technical content for anybody interested in
deploying Agora at their institution. We will commence the talk with
a live demonstration.

Ontologies and Semantic Interoperability for Humanities Data
19 June 2007, 2007 1pm- 3pm
The lecture will cover some of the problems of semantic
interoperability for arts and humanities data. The central aim of
this workshop is to discuss existing case studies and a research
agenda for linking arts and humanities data in a semantic metadata
management system across multiple heterogeneous collections. The
lecture will cover an introduction to ontologies as a formal semantic
view of data by structuring it and creating tags to define semantic
relationships across collections. This introduction to ontologies
will be followed by a set of examples for ontologies and annotation
standards in general for the humanities. Afterwards, the scope of the
investigation will be expanded and other disciplines will be included
in order to present new semantic data and information integration
approaches (from classical ones, like OBSERVER, TSIMMIS, Carnot,
etc., to newer Semantic-Web approaches, like DWQ, KnowledgeParser,
D2R, R2O, etc.). In the last part of the talk, conclusions will be
delivered for the future use of ontologies in a humanities metadata
management system by considering some requirements for such a system.
The two speakers include experts from the humanities and from
computer science specifialised in ontological engineering. Mark
Greengrass
(<<a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/history/staff/early_modern/mark_greengrass.html">http://www.shef.ac.uk/history/staff/early_modern/mark_greengrass.html</a>>)
is a Professor of Early Modern History in Sheffield. He is
co-investigator at the 'Ontology-based Historical Mining in
Armadillo' project and will report on the experiences of that
project. The second speaker is Oscar Corcho
(<<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ocorcho/">http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ocorcho/</a>>
) who is working as a Marie Curie fellow at the Information
Management Group of the University of Manchester. His research
activities include the Semantic Grid, the Semantic Web, and
Ontological Engineering. He participates at the European project
OntoGrid and published a book about 'Ontological Engineering'. Oscar
will answer to Mark's experiences in the Armadillo project and will
introduce some of the latest developments in ontological engineering
that might help address some of the issues involved.

Collaborative Text Editing

Speakers
Gabriel Bodard
King's College London
Open Source Critical (= Transparent, Technically Explicit, and
Collaborative) Editions
The interest I have in collaborative research is focussed on the
question of protocols and standards for creating edited texts in
useful digital format. I shall consider these issues under the
general label of "Open Source Critical Editions", a term which I
shall briefly explain. "Open Source" is a reference to publishing and
making transparent the source code as well as the source data for the
decisions, with the explicit expectation that this be reused and
recirculated by future studies and editions. "Critical" indicates the
assumption that these digital texts are not only critically
respectably, but contain explicit machine-actionable indication of
the scholarly thinking and evidence behind the decisions presented.
"Editions" is not an entirely neutral term either, as it may
encompass eclectic editions of multiple manuscripts, for example, as
well as detailed transcriptions of individual witnesses and even
unique textual objects such as papyri, inscriptions, coins, etc. I
shall touch on the implications of collaborative editing and
annotation of such texts, and I shall also consider some models of
attribution for such work (the detailed mechanisms of both of these
issues will be discussed in more detail by Juan Garces.)

The AMI Meeting Corpus
The AMI Meeting Corpus contains 100 hours of meetings captured using
many synchronized recording devices, and is designed to support work
in speech and video processing, language engineering, corpus
linguistics, and organizational psychology. It has been transcribed
orthographically, with annotated subsets for everything from named
entities, dialogue acts, and summaries to simple gaze and head
movement. Much of the annotation was created using the NITE XML
Toolkit, which allows a distributed set of users to create, store,
browse, and search annotations for the same base data that are both
time-aligned against signal and related to each other structurally. I
will describe the process of designing and creating this complex data
set, how we are encouraging it to grow, and the technical challenges
this presents for its future maintenance.

The London Charter
www.londoncharter.org
FOR THE USE OF 3-DIMENSIONAL VISUALISATION IN THE RESEARCH AND
COMMUNICATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
The aim of this announcement is to draw the attention of relevant
subject communities to the Charter, encourage discussion of its Draft
Principles and invite expressions of interest and comments that may help
in refining this document.
The London Charter aims to establish internationally-recognised
principles for the use of 3D visualisation by researchers, educators and
cultural heritage organisations.
Since the first draft was published in March 2006, the London Charter
has attracted significant international interest, including strong
endorsement by the 90-institution-strong EPOCH Network of Excellence in
Processing Open Cultural Heritage (EU FP 6), which has described the
Charter as "one of its most important achievements", and by senior
representatives of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and
Activities and the Flemish Heritage Institute. Translations into
Japanese, Polish and several other languages are planned.
The Charter aims to establish principles essential to the achievement of
intellectual integrity and transparency in the use of 3D visualisation
for cultural heritage, and to provide guidelines for sustainability and
access.
The London Charter is advised by a Board of international experts and
co-chaired by Professor Richard Beacham (King's College London) and
Professor Franco Niccolucci (University of Florence), and benefits from
the participation of a wider Interest Group. Activities are coordinated
by Dr Hugh Denard (KCL) and Dr Sorin Hermon (Florence). The JISC 3D
Visualisation in the Arts Network (3DVisA) is Secretariat to the
initiative.
The Charter arose out of a symposium and expert seminar held in London
in February 2006 convened by the King's Visualisation Lab funded by the
AHRC, and jointly sponsored by the AHRC ICT Methods Network and EPOCH,
during which over 50 international delegates debated approaches to the
issue of intellectual transparency.

In "Making a living from the rapidly changing British way of death"
(The Guardian for Saturday, 16 June), Oliver Burkeman writes of new
things at the biggest-ever gathering of the British funeral industry.
"And the message it came to deliver was clear: reaping doesn't always
have to be grim" -- nor traditional:
[deleted quotation]One might wish to enquire into the guarantees of stability and
longevity for the online service used to host the memorial site. Or
is there a more subtle message to be read here? Mircea Eliade
somewhere declared that certain ancient ways of burial provided a
stone body for the departed soul -- when it was believed that there
was an eternal soul who might be in need of a body to inhabit. But
now that "carpe diem" comes closer to the dominant belief (if belief
is the right word), perhaps the uncertainty of anything digital, no
matter how well backed up, stands for us more profoundly than we had
imagined. Indeed, the next sentence of the article from which I have
quoted expresses more or less the same implication organically:
[deleted quotation]Here is indeed a topic in the cultural studies of the world in which
computing has emerged. But, then, before one makes too much of these
thoughts as a sign of the these times alone,

[The following relates to a recent decision by the Arts and
Humanities Research Council, the primary funding body for the
humanities in the UK, to terminate funding of the Arts and Humanities
Data Service (<a href="http://www.ahds.ac.uk/">http://www.ahds.ac.uk/</a>), the UK national service aiding
the discovery, creation and preservation of digital resources in and
for research, teaching and learning in the arts and humanities. This
decision was taken in the mistaken and ill-informed belief that each
university is now capable of doing the work of the AHDS for itself,
implying either (a) that perfect coordination will take care of
itself, or (b) that arts and humanities data really don't matter in
the long term. Response from the world-wide community would be most
welcome. --WM]
Dear colleagues,
A letter has been sent to the British Arts and Humanities Research
Council, asking for clarification on the future of digital
preservation and dissemination of good practice given the AHRC's
recent announcement [[1]] that funding for the Arts and Humanities
Data Service (AHDS) will be terminated early next year. This
information-seeking letter (copied at [[2]]) has been signed on
behalf of the Digital Classicist, Antiquist, Digital Medievalist, and
TEI communities.
Any comments on this letter, or on the AHRC's eventual response, may
be discussed here and/or in the comments thread at [[3]].

Subject: Ideal readers for a database?
Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2007 06:43:20 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 152 (152)

Dear all,
after some experience with databases --- corpora, to be more precise ---
of ancient Greek and Latin (and Neolatin) texts, a question occurs.  What
kind of an "ideal reader" (or "ideal user") did the designers of those
databases / corpora have in mind?  For whom are those databases designed?
What is very easy to do with them --- and what is quite uncomfortably
difficult to achieve?
Greek and Latin corpora that I know make it very easy to find occurrences
of words, and (therefore) verbal similarities between texts.  On the other
hand, it is difficult to create one's own subcorpora there; it is not
quite simple to search writers just from one period (i. e.
synchronically), or from just one genre.  It requires, also, special skill
to follow ideas, not words.  It is difficult to annotate a text, to mark
interesting places (you have to go outside the database for this).  It is
practically impossible to add other texts to databases.  It is impossible
to consult different readings (apparatus criticus) of a text.
There is another kind of corpus --- the Perseus --- which makes it very
easy to study the text as a student, providing access to the dictionary,
translations, lexica (kind of "school" corpus).  But this corpus is
difficult to search (or research) as a corpus, as a collection of texts;
and genres and periods are accessible with difficulty here as well.
What are your experiences with databases / corpora in your fields of
expertise?  For whom do these databases / corpora seem to be written /
designed?  What do they enable you to do --- and what do they, excuse the
pun, disable?

About the approach of the title: you'll be the best judge, I'd think, though
the former is most likely, as you already suggest.

We intend to have video of all institute speakers available on the website

[deleted quotation]merely naive.
[deleted quotation]I think this is at least partly due to our failure in finding a suitable form
for poetry in the digital world. It differs from prose in that almost all
poetical works go through a much longer series of drafts. The text emerges
almost like a dimmer switch being turned up, gradually focussing on the images
the poet wants to convey. I like the quote from Paul Valery: 'There are no
finished poems, only abandoned ones'. We can't represent that yet in the
digital medium where everything must be so stark and explicit. Actually the
print medium was worse: one couldn't change a text once printed but one can
change an electronic text. When the transformation to a digital society is
finally complete there may be a place for poetry in it.

Subject: pedagogical value of simulations
Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2007 09:22:13 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 161 (161)

Thanks to my colleague John Lavagnino, I have come across a letter to
the editor of the American Physical Society News 16.6 (June 2007),
"Can Simulations Really Teach Physics?" by Robert Shafer (Los
Alamos). He is responding to the assertion that since real events
happen too fast to be observed in the laboratory, it's better to
watch simulations of them in slow motion on the computer. He makes
the case for "doing the real thing, even if the equipment has to be
improvised", rather than watching it being done.
Recently, in conversation with a physicist at UCLA, I asked about
computing in his discipline, specifically whether simulations of
otherwise unobservable realities -- let's say, just to have an
example, subatomic events at the core of an imploding star -- produce
anything anyone can be certain of. His answer was that now there are
in essence three kinds of physics -- theoretical, experimental,
computational -- and that in computational physics "they do things
differently there" (to quote L. P. Hartley's novel). If the
simulation is plausible, matching everything else one can know, then
it takes on the status of something one can learn from.
Where do we sort in all this? Is it fair to say that since the
phenomena we study are also not directly observable, our simulacra
play a similar role? If we make a distinction between modelling
something we can get to otherwise, e.g. by reading or looking, and
simulating that which we cannot get to except after the fact, such as
possible patterns of influence, then could we draw a parallel between
computational physics and, say, a computational literary studies? Are
statistical studies of literature an example?
Yours,
WM

Subject: the greatest threat?
Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2007 08:15:25 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 162 (162)

With good and laudable motivations we habitually identify and make
much of the benefits that computing offers to the humanities. With
more than a little cultural provincialism and personal forgetfulness,
we treat change (a.k.a. innovation) as if it were in itself one of
these benefits, or perhaps even the meta-benefit brought by
computing. But, one would think, understanding of what's happening is
a greater, more inclusive good, and in the long haul more prudent. So
let me ask in this spirit what is the greatest threat posed by
computing? For purposes of sharpening the discussion, if any ensues,
let's begin with the world marked out by the research we do. What
about computing most threatens this world?
My own suggestion is to put near or at the very top of our list the
quasi-Blakean "expanding eyes" which the perspective of humanities
computing on the humanities demands of us. This demand is hardly new,
of course. It isn't computing's unique gift to the crowded,
landlocked bunch of self-obsessed intellectual principalities many
seem in practice to take the disciplines to be -- as if they were
abstractions derived from the academic departments of some powerful
university (pick your favourite example). Indeed, a better argument
is that contrariwise this demand is the humanities' gift to
computing, or more accurately, the creative genius that computing has
shared with the humanities from its beginning. Be that as it may,
humanities computing is nothing of real and lasting interest, it
seems to me, if practitioners do not reach out in every direction,
into every discipline, for the help required by its interdisciplinary
nature. Doing that *is* threatening, I suggest, to those who, like
Bruegel's stolid farmer, plough their small patches of ground with no
awareness of the great world beyond.
In Poetics of Relation (Michigan, 1997) the philosopher Edouard
Glissant uses the archipelago-like configuration of his native
Caribbean islands as the metaphorical basis for construing the world
differently from the dominant European model of landlocked
intellectual principalities -- and the equally fixed Tree of
Knowledge famously depicted by  the 13C philosopher Ramon Llull (do a
Google image-search for "arbor scientiae"). Glissant begins with
Gilles Deleuze's and Felix Guattari's criticism of the idea of rooted
knowledge, "a stock taking all upon itself and killing all around
it", and their alternative, the metaphor of the rhizome, or enmeshed
root-system. Glissant draws out their congruent praise of
intellectual nomadism, which they contrast with the settled, rooted
way of life. Glissant pulls apart the idea of nomadism into different
kinds: the circular nomadism of those who move with the seasons, in
an eternal return to familiar pastures; the invading nomadism of
conquering hordes, restlessly arrow-like; and the nomadism of the
exile, whose wanderings were, he points out, praised in antiquity as
a necessary stage in one's intellectual development. (I like to think
autobiographically in terms of the ex-patriot mentality, my colleague
Simon Tanner in terms of being lapsed from one's original
faith.)  But Glissant goes further by linking the various ways of
thinking precisely to where we are in the world as it now is being
re-constituted. And from this follows the argument for
re-constituting our academies, and so for re-configuring disciplinary
and esp interdisciplinary practices to accord with the world as it is
becoming. Humanities computing comes at a crucial moment.
But, again, the greatest threat, which I experience and imagine as a
matter of what papers get accepted to conferences and how they are
reviewed, and what books and articles get written and how they
are  received. A matter of what we think we're about, but more
immediately, what disturbs, what pricks us on, what serves as our
Lenny Bruce.. My suggestion and question is to pay closest attention
to all those signs of annoyance, impatience and misunderstanding --
not so that we may soothe ruffled feathers and get on with things but
so that we can better detect where the real interest lies.

Dear Neven,
you present some interesting questions for software engineers to
consider. I am not sure that I manage to answer these questions below
but I may be able to give you some insight into "the" database (or
more accurately software) development process.
Developing software is a tough job, and usually begins with a
Specification of Requirements document from a client (who may or may
not be the eventual user). Then, following a series of discussions
between the client and analyst, a software design is produced.
Traditionally, this design was handed over to the software developer
and the software was eventually produced and presented to the client.
Typically, the software met the requirements in the design document
(as far as the developer was concerned) but may not have met the
original client's requirements for a variety of reasons. More modern
approaches (depending on the size of the project) attempt to include
the client at all phases of the development process, in the hope that
the eventual product meets the initial requirements. Most projects
suffer from "requirements drift", however. This is because clients'
requirements, software tools, and developers' humours naturally
change over time, and this impacts on the eventual product. Including
the user at all phases, in fact, also impacts on requirements drift.
Returning to your question about the ideal user; these are usually
modelled early in the development process (using something called the
Universal Modelling Language; or the UML). This happens in a phase
called "Use Case Scenario Modelling". Here, the user activities and
interactions (with the software or other users) is "put down in black
and white", and is seen as one of the fundamental "invariants" in
modern software development. A change here (requirements drift)
impacts on all later phases of development as this model is used to
drive the development of software structure (called Class Models) and
User Interaction (Interaction Sequence Diagrams). Your term "ideal
user" is excellent, because this is what the Use Case model
represents. In short, if the client doesn't specify all ideal users,
then it is unlikely that the ultimate software will facilitate the
requirements of non-ideal users. If it does, then one begins to worry
about the software developer -- did he or she ignore the user model?
If this is the case, then what other aspects of the other models have
been ignored?
I teach software engineering and in particular software development
to second year computer science students. Most of the work is about
forward engineering computer code form specifications. This is a
tough job, as it requires human intervention and relies on human
interpretation of users' requirements. The general consensus is
always the same: we need users to become skilled in "requirements
modelling" and also require software engineers to think about users
as partners (and not "lusers").
So these are my thoughts on the general question you pose. I have
assumed, from the content of your message, that you make no
distinction between the software used to access the database and the
database itself. I'll get back to you later on databases, and "what
is possible"  in a later message. It may be possible to do more with
a database that was originally intended -- often this relies on the
flexibility of the data manipulation interface. If you make it (the
DML) too complex, users will not be able to use it to access the
data; if you make it to simple then users will not be able to use it
to answer their research questions. To quote the Rolling Stones ...
"you can't always get what you want, but if you try sometime, you
might just get what you need".
More later on how you can design a database to give you what you
need. This is my first post to this list; apologies if it doesn't
give you what you need.

Announcing this week's instalment of the Digital Classicist/ICS Work in
Progress Summer seminars
Tim Hill (Cambridge)
'Wiser than the Undeceived? Past Worlds as Virtual Worlds in the
Electronic Media'
Time: Friday 22 June at 16:30
Place: Room NG16 Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU
Brief abstract:
Despite frequent claims that the electronic media represent a decisive
break with the textual past, when software designers claim to recreate
historical realities in their work questions long-familiar to
classicists immediately arise. What can or should be represented? What
ought the relationship between reality and representation be? What is
the relationship between cognition and emotion in artistic
representations? In earlier periods, the limitations of computer
processing speed and power rendered answers to such questions de facto
or purely speculative; as the sophistication of digital representation
increases, however, it is becoming clear that meaningful modern
responses to these ancient philosophical questions must be based not
upon computational, but formal and generic, criteria.
All are welcome.
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments after which
everyone is also welcome to join us in entertaining the speaker at a
local venue.

Dear Willard,
[deleted quotation]Having trained as an experimental physicist (at postgraduate level)
and studies both experimental and theoretical physics at
undergraduate level I was terribly excited by this letter, and the
rekindling of internal debates I believed were settled!
As a student, I was one of those kind that spent as much time writing
programs to assist with the experiments, as I did conducting the
experiments -- quiet often receiving no marks, and sometimes
receiving less marks for my programs. Despite my inclinations towards
simulation, I found that there was no substitute for "doing the real
thing" ... until I encountered Quantum Mechanics. I then realised
that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (which informs that the
position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured
with arbitrarily high precision, i.e. there is a minimum for the
product of the uncertainties of both measurements) informed that even
with perfect instruments and techniques the uncertainty inherent in
nature meant that physical experiments would provide limited
understanding of physical phenomena. I spent a distressing final year
searching for a new experiment that would verify any quantum
mechanical effect, with no success. In the end, I adopted a "quantum
like approach" -- all approaches (experimental, theoretical and
computational) existed equally, until I was forced to fix on one or
another (at which point I would be completely unsure about the
appropriateness of the other two).
[deleted quotation]This is interesting -- I believe simulations can tell you nothing,
everything and something in between. I remember speaking to a physics
professor, about the value of simulations, at a conference about
simulating the dynamics of the Earth's mesosphere. He was presenting
results from a semi- empirical model based on observed data and an
established general circulation model. My concerns rested in the
generation of the computer programs, and whether one could trust the
programs? I believed that I could write a program that gave the same
answers as his model -- my program would not encapsulate any physical
theories nor use observed data. He challenged me to do so, and I
wrote a program that interpolated the output of his model. My program
was only a couple of hundred lines long and was just a simulation of
his simulation. I cheated a little, but I had made my point. I
believe that computational physicists certainly do things
differently! In order to know what their programs are doing, we need
to be involved in their generation, or have access to the program
models, design, code and test suites.
In response to your question, I believe that there is evidence from
particle physics studies where simulations of unobserved realities
(new particles) aid later discoveries. The greatest value of
simulations, I believe, is that they can show you where to look.
[deleted quotation]  From a theoretical perspective, I think you would have to (i)
establish if there are analogous concrete natural uncertainty laws
that apply to your area of study, (ii) unambiguously determine the
uncertainty model, and (iii) prove (or at least establish)
relationships between observables, i.e. minimum for the product  of
the uncertainties of both measurements (or observables). Where,
exactly, are the uncertainties that lead to phenomena not being
directly observable? Are they emotional reactions, etc. arising from
reading or observing something? I  wold have reservations about
selecting emotional reaction, for example, as an "uncertain
observable," as I do not think is as invariant or absolute an
observable as say  (physical) position. Furthermore, if one
subscribes to Baroness Susan Greenfield's theory that Tomorrow's
people will be influenced (physically and emotionally) by today's
technologies, then there is even less reason to be concerned about
observables -- we'll just make people the way we want them (to be and
to behave). Tomorrow's peoples' patterns of influence may, in fact,
be programmable.
[deleted quotation]I know very little about statistical studies of literature, Willard,
but I'd like to tell you something of my ongoing arguments with
humanities researchers about "statistical studies" of historical
records. If I was mathematically, or physically minded, I would pay
careful attention to source sampling. For example, if I wanted to
take hundreds of manuscripts, digitise them, and optimise storage, I
would perform sound techniques like principal component analysis to
ensure that I could rebuild the source from the sampled data.
However, I find that researchers who are dealing with textual records
are often happy to only extract and make data sets from records of
interest to them, for example, building a database of Irish prisoners
in 1800 from prison records. Later someone may, using the same
source, build a database of French prisoners for the same period,
using the same records. It would appear, in such cases, that the
observer is more important than the observation; something that would
concern any physicist!
I believe that there a problem with the latter approach; and it
relates to the title of your post "pedagogical value of simulations".
Students working with the digital (albeit image based) copy of the
manuscript can essentially have a similar experiences to working with
the original. Selective data set generation, however, is not a good
sampling approach as it may not be possible to rebuild the source
from the samples. This means that simulations using these data have
poor pedagogical value as the  simulations are really only valid for
the original observations and not the source. Students, however, may
draw conclusions about the source rather than the observation. It is
a lot like my simulation of a simulation (described earlier).
I believe that it is always a good idea to utilise the best possible
digitisation schemes available to "capture" a source. There is little
pedagogical value in learning with sources derived from poor
sampling, especially in the absence of a complete theoretical model.
Best wishes, John.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 167 (167)

The results of a survey carried out by the Australasian Digital
Theses program have recently been released. The full report is
available at
<a href="http://adt.caul.edu.au/memberinformation/submissionsurvey/survey2006.doc">http://adt.caul.edu.au/memberinformation/submissionsurvey/survey2006.doc</a>.
It applies to the deposit of open access electronic copies of
research theses (eg PhD) in university repositories in Australia and
New Zealand (and thence searchable through the ADT gateway
<a href="http://adt.caul.edu.au/">http://adt.caul.edu.au/</a>).
It is apparent from the report (and indeed highlighted by the
authors) that a mandatory deposit policy results in a submission rate
of 95% of all theses accepted, while its absence results in a
submission rate of 17-22% (in other words, a pitifully empty
repository). While this should not be news to anyone, the report has
hard quotable facts on the success of an institutional mandatory
policy over a substantial population of universities.
59% (ie 33) of Australian and New Zealand universities have mandatory
deposit policies in place in 2007, so the technological change has
gone well beyond the tipping point. I expect the remaining 41% of
universities to follow suit in the very near future; the report
suggests that 24% had already started planning to this end in 2006.
In another interesting fact, three universities have provision for a
thesis to be lodged electronically only (in other words no paper
copy) and one is considering it. It is not clear how much this
provision is used for hypermedia theses, or if it will spread.

I suspect that the TLG, at least, was originally conceived as a
replacement for concordances, and so the software usually used to access
its texts is oriented around the traditional uses of concordances. It
never struck me as being intended for readers. Leaving out the app crit
is a more interesting issue; when the TLG was first created, there was
no TEI (I'm not even sure how far along SGML was), and so there was no
standard way to mark variants in a text file. Now, for a purely
speculative thought: I suppose it is also possible that the publishers
of the editions that the TLG used as copy texts might have been
concerned about putting themselves out of business; and since the app
crit is probably the most important aspect of the publisher's editorial
contribution to an edition of an ancient text (excluding, of course,
texts with commentaries), it seems like an obvious element of the text
for the publisher to exclude from any reprinting agreement.

[deleted quotation]Could it also be that aspects of the so called "democratizing power of
the digital media" threaten vestiges of the ivory tower mentality
embodied-- sometimes-- in the idea of the peer-review system? It seems
to me that in many ways, traditonally, the concept is built on the
assumption of specialized disciplinary knowledge understood by many in
terms of landlocked principalities--the quality assurance seems to rest
on 'plowing small patches of (disciplinary) ground' for a reputable
amount of time which bestows on the venture an air of deep truth,
objectivity, solid disciplinary knowledge...I am not being facetios,
nor skeptical, since there is a lot to be said about
the need for a system related to quality control, but the kind of
radical interdisciplinarity the digital medium often encourages does
threaten the system thus conceived--it is asking it to be more flexible
and expansive than it is, and this may be interpreted as a threat to
quality assurance.
Many before me have observed that any change concerning relatively
stable realities in general will be experienced as threatening....
something to do with survival instincts that have nothing to do with

Willard,
I have had several quite positive experiences using simulations for
educational purposes.
In physics, it is possible to give students a "feel" for the laws of
planetary motion by allowing them to manipulate variables in a simulated
solar system and arrive at Kepler's laws.  It is also possible for them to
gain a facility with the combination of vectors by "shooting" simulated free
throws in basketball by inputting the horizontal and vertical components of
force applied to the simulated ball and watching the resulting trajectory as
the gravity vector is also applied.
In the social sciences, I once taught an entire course using a large
simulation called "APEX" (Air Pollution Exercise), that was based on
Lansing, Michigan, with an emphasis on air pollution.  Students played
various roles in the community (politicians, industrialists, developers, air
pollution control officers, news media, etc.)  They were provided with a
computer printout of their current status and had to interact, based on that
status, making decisions for their roles for that cycle.  Their decisions
were then used as input for the computer to generate the status for the next
cycle.  On alternate weeks we had the interactions.  In between we had
seminars with guests on relevant basic social science topics, such as urban
planning, government structure, economics, etc.  The game served as the
stimulus for all sorts of discussion and learning.  The (unplanned by me)
climax occurred when one of the air pollution control officers was observed
accepting a "bribe" from an industrialist.  That inspired me to invite a
friend/neighbor who was an assistant U.S. Attorney to come to class and
conduct a "trial."  It was a wonderful learning experience, with students
taking on the roles of attorneys, jurors, courtroom staff, etc.  My friend
orchestrated it and served as "judge."  The student course evaluations as
well as my own observations confirmed that they learned a wide range of
social sciences and were able to relate what they learned to their own
lives. It was a great success.
I know also of industrial uses of simulations that are considered to be
quite valuable.  Caterpillar, the company that manufactures huge
construction and farming equipment, routinely uses three-dimensional,
virtual simulations of their prototypes before actually constructing them.
It is far more efficient to "construct" them in software and make
modifications than to build working models and find they need to be
redesigned.  As another example, my younger son creates the code for
simulations of potential new supercomputers before they are actually built.
The entire computer is simulated to determine whether it will perform as
predicted, without having to go to the expense of actually building a
prototype.
Depending on one's definition of simulation, we might consider the virtual
"unrolling" of ancient scrolls as a simulation.  However, I cannot offer
other good examples of positive benefits of simulations in the humanities;
perhaps someone else can.

John Keating has shown how thinking about readers / users and the database
/ corpus fits well into "Coding and composing" theme we had recently on
Humanist.  But, I think, John's insight also implies that designing a
database interface is more alike to staging a play, or making a movie, or
performing an opera --- than to writing a novel.
If, let us say, Umberto Eco writes a novel, he has, supposedly, an "ideal
reader" of his novel in mind.  His notion of such a reader may be foggy or
unclear --- but he will stick to it throughout the novel; if the notion
changes, chances are Eco will rewrite the whole text.  There is no "third
man" between Eco and reader (editors...?).
But, if I want to produce a database of Latin texts, I will go and hire
somebody to program an interface according to my needs (as John so clearly
described).  Here --- as with a play, a movie, an opera --- the result of
performing together may be unexpected; the motives and interpretations may
clash, or go their own separate ways.
But the question --- the responsibility --- of the author, the prime
mover, remains.  Will the author --- the client --- first sit down and
meditate on what does he want the database to be used for?  Or will he
simply go to the programmers and say, "well, here are all those classical
Latin texts, I want to make them searchable" (remember Willard's fable)?
Here we come to what Patrick Rourke has written about the TLG.  Some
things were not imaginable at the time the Thesaurus linguae Graecae was
first designed and produced; immense practical difficulties (coding the
alphabet, getting texts into the computer) had to be solved --- and were
solved; questions of copyright were at the horizon (who owns the rights to
apparatus criticus).  It looks like people behind the TLG asked
themselves, "What is the most time- and energy-consuming task in classical
philology that the computers can be used for?"  And the reply was,
"concordances".
But what can we do now, what is to be done today?  At least two roads seem
possible.  We can look at the discipline --- in my case, the Classics ---
and ask, what do we do today?  And how can we enable people to do more of
it, and better?  Or, we can look at the corpus, and ask: what is *not*
being done in the discipline today?  How can we enable people to do
*that*?
This is why I am interested in what *other* disciplines are doing with
their corpora and databases.

Hi Neven,
The questions of who are the users and what do they want are the first
ones that the human-computer interaction designers say we must ask, so
I think these are the right questions. However, we should also realise
that the "ideal user" changes with time, as do the things that they
think they want. Often, it is only when one has built an interface that
one can be in a position to criticise it. I think that the online
corpora you are referring to, in spite of their many useful features,
are probably too inflexible in their design. It would be nice if you
could easily do the things you suggest - perhaps you are thinking of
interfaces on other websites not related to Greek and Latin corpora
that already do this. But there is one good reason why it is not
already so for us too, and that is money. How do you find the funding
to do these kinds of things? The humanities has a fraction of the
financial support of other disciplines, so things change only slowly. I
think the only solution to this can be co-operation in the design of
software for humanities projects. There is enough money if we can all
agree on how to spend it. The free software paradigm might emend this
situation, though it hasn't yet.
However, you make another valid point, when you complain that it is
difficult "to consult different readings". When we directly transfer
the printed structures of "edition" and "apparatus criticus" into the
digital medium we are like the early printers who made books in the
image of manuscripts. It took them 100 years to realise their mistake.
We still think of the text as one version, whereas in fact it is many.
This fact has to be built into the archive itself and made the
fundamental structure of the text. Otherwise we will forever be
scratching around trying to compare a text here in one format with a
text there in another, or building closed systems that do what we want
but don't interact with others. Markup can't record variation very well
but markup is what we are seemingly stuck with, and that is why I think
it is difficult to build the flexibility you crave.

Dear Neven,
It has been a busy week and I never managed to get to send the second
half of my reply to your previous message; I was going to say
something about databases.
Traditionally, the user interaction part of (database) software was
was the only route to accessing the data. This was typically stored
in some proprietary organisational structure and encoding mechanism,
presumably to protect the intellectual property of the developers,
and to minimise copying and distribution. Nowadays, we want all of
the data to be accessible via the Internet, so client-sever models
abound. The problem with the latter approach is that the interaction
mechanisms provided by the client software are are not as extensive
as those provided by custom- developed user interfaces -- we end up
with a "same old, same old" approach to layout, interaction, query
models, presentation, etc. The HTTP protocol and web browsers, which
have become the new operating system, are responsible I believe, for
fundamentally limiting the way people think about accessing,
visualising and utilising data extracted from databases. Another
problem is protection of intellectual property, i.e. the encoding
used by the development team is usually "hidden" from the client
software (and the user). You referred to this in your recent post
(the writings of Patrick Rourke).
Usually, I find that there is no grand plan to data architecture; of
course, there need not be! If data are available in one format then
it is usually straightforward to write transformation programs to get
them into another if one has access. This (access issue) is terribly
important, because certain data manipulation and querying mechanisms
are sometimes only achievable if data have a particular structure. To
answer research questions, via a series of database queries may rely
on first transforming the data representation in some way.
Mathematicians do this all the time; for example, it may not be
possible to analytically integrate a mathematical function in
real-space, but if it is represented in complex space the integration
becomes doable (analytically). Computer graphics programmers
represent 3D points in a 4D world to help with transformations. I
always encourage my humanities colleagues to think of data
organisation as being flexible; it can and should change as often as
the researcher requires.
Doing something like this requires collaboration and agreement
between research groups --  which is probably harder than developing
new software! A co-ordinated approach to data sharing, and
data-encoding standards sharing will go a long way towards developing
database systems that aid researchers do more, and do it better.
I really like your analogies with literature -- thank you; I'll share
this with my students -- my personal analogy is formal dancing where
are two key  participants, the researcher and software engineer. Each
work together to produce something transient, yet beautiful.
Sometimes one partner takes the lead, or has focus, and then the
other leads. The success and beauty of the dance depends on
co-operation,  fluidly of movement, and competencies of the partners.
Finding the right partners is crucial, I expect, for dancing and
software development projects.
This can work, however; let me give you an example (as you asked what
other people are doing). As part of the Irish in Europe project
(<a href="http://www.irishineurope.ie/">http://www.irishineurope.ie/</a>) partners are working towards building
a virtual research platform for humanities researchers. I attended
several colloquia where researchers presented data on their
specialised research, however, I was concerned that no one partner
could compare or merge his or her (prosopographical) data with
another data set in any formal statistical, numerical, or
organisational manner. This seemed the most natural thing for me do
do (I trained as a Physicist) so I asked my History colleagues to
work on an XML schema so that a publicly accessible database could be
built. It has taken years, but we have a schema that most people are
happy with; if we need to change it then we can do that with ease.
Researchers are now offering substantial data sets for inclusion in
the project and we have obtained funding to build an online virtual
collaborative-working environment for contributors, researchers,
students and the general public.
For the moment all of the conversion to XML from other formats will
be performed by myself and my students. Once we have finished the
initial phase of XML encoding we will be in a position to make global
data architectural changes with ease. Having all data in a similar
format, and having an openly- accessible schema, means that other
developers can build software tools knowing that if the tools work
with one data set, they will work for all data sets. We also believe
that a concentrated investment in developing open data architecture
standards now, is the best way to enable future generations of
researchers and developers do more, and do it better.
We (historians and software engineers) have also been playing with
the idea of incorporating "what can we do" features into the schema;
in addition to the "what is it like" features. One of my MSc students
built a nice piece of software which examined the XML encoded data,
and informed the researchers what type of statistical queries would
be possible using this field.
My personal goal (as a software developer working with humanities
researchers) is to develop databases containing lots of
metainformation that will allow computer programs to write analysis-
based computer programs based on researchers' requirements. My ideal
future is where humanities researchers will be presented with a data
set, and accompanying programs that help specify what is required of
the data (queries, visualisation, analyses). These inputs are then
used by the programs to write and develop other computer programs
that are tailored to the researchers' requirements. If the
requirements change, then new programs can be re-developed. I believe
that many computer programs (especially the front-ends to database
systems) are also just data, and can be specified and produced
automatically. I believe this work is necessary because industrial
influences will most certainly ensure that the software we use
"today" won't work "tomorrow". So we need to concentrate some effort
on formal specification of what we expect of data and how we work
with data, in a general sense, not just with front-end software
interfaces to databases. Them, when the software changes, we can
still "do" what we want to "do" regardless of software change. There
is a lot of work to be done in automated construction of ontologies
in the field of software engineering, however!
So, in response to your question on what is *not* being done -- we
are not preparing for the future; software change and obsolescence
will be detrimental to our progress. Deal with this issue now;
challenge the computer scientists; and work towards developing open
data architecture standards.
Best wishes, John.

In Humanist 21.120 Neven develops an implication in John Keating's response,
[deleted quotation]Here Neven puts into a nutshell essential dynamics of a collaborative
research project. Part of that which is unexpected, as my colleague
Harold Short says, is the product of a bilateral curiosity. Under the
best of circumstances, exercising this curiosity changes the
understandings with which each side entered into the collaboration.
If for a moment we leave aside the implications of there being a
"prime mover", someone clearly in charge, we get to Neven's question:
[deleted quotation]Experience suggests that the author/client is most likely to arrive
with his or her research question in mind but little else, or perhaps
with just a notion that somehow computing may provide some help for a
left-over bit of research that would be nice to tidy away, if
possible. (I suppose that if one did a proper study of the topic, one
would discover a whole range of initial states, from the utterly
vague to the tightly focused, but that the majority of author/clients
would be clear about their research, vague about what computing might
do.) Given curiosity sufficiently robust, what one would hope for is
that a problem emerges in the interaction between the two sides that
provokes new or better research questions *on both sides*.
[deleted quotation]In the Bad Old Days when emergent humanities computing practitioners
were stuck at help-desks, we were told that the question to ask was,
"What do you want to do?" The idea was that the researcher, on the
other side of an institutionally unbridgeable abyss, would then state
a problem for which the technical practitioner would provide a solution
by writing suitable code or, somewhat later, by pulling the right
application off the shelf. Surely this actually happened a fair bit,
but in those Bad Old Days I certainly witnessed the interchange that
we now know to be an achievable -- and frequently achieved -- goal.
So I may begin with the question to Neven, what do you want to be
able to do? But we all know it has to go further than that, much further.
[deleted quotation]Indeed -- more of the same faster and better, or something new? How
does one arrive at that "something new"?
[deleted quotation]I hope numerous responses to this interest are made here. Indeed,
facilitating such cross-disciplinary talk is one of the major roles
of humanities computing across the digital humanities and one if its
best rationales. But meanwhile, perhaps as much or more productive,
is for people like me to ask people like Neven, where is your
research running into trouble? Where are the frustrations? What seems
wrong or frustratingly limiting with the software you can get your
hands on? What do the anomalies tell you? The result I expect from
such an interchange is that we are much better able to adumbrate a
data-model or kind of procedure that no existing software or design
for software currently satisfies. Perhaps also -- this is my
particular interest in such interchanges -- we come to a better
understanding of the kind of language and the styles of reasoning we
need to be able to ask the questions we need to ask. Mostly, I think,
we're like Papageno with his padlocked lips, able only to make some
noises -- in tune, if we try very hard.
As we edge away from modelling something we know intellectually how
to model, and administratively how to justify, toward the unknown,
play enters the picture, and moving out into the unknown
conjecturally, with no justification, becomes increasingly important.
If Neven took up some gizmo X, something important might happen. How
do we reduce the cost of that (primarily the time required to do it),
so that he can afford to play? If he were to notice some curious
analogy between what's happening in a text and, say, evolutionary
biology, how can we make it an easy matter to try that analogy out?
How can we maximize the speculative power and flexibility of computing?
Finally to Neven's authorial "prime mover". What about the
consequences of being in the role of the one whose job is to wait to
be moved, and then, when the push comes, having no choice as to
direction? This is even more basic a problem than who gets credit for
publications from a collaborative project.
Consider the builder whom you hire, say to extend your kitchen; let
this person be an imaginative and highly skilled person. In early
days, he or she will be learning constantly, whatever the assignment.
But what are the satisfactions once this builder has learned what is
to be learned from more or less random jobs? What happens to such a
person when he or she gets particularly interested in kitchens, say?
And then what happens when he or she has exhausted the imaginative
possibilities of kitchens?
Consider the cabinetmaker, who learns through apprenticeship, then on
completion of a masterwork, becomes a master of the trade. Great
satisfactions there, I would suppose, no matter what sort of  cabinet
is called for.
Consider the architect, who starts as a dogsbody in someone's firm,
then with considerable luck and talent progresses to his or her own
firm. Few will make the grade to  the kind of architect who takes on
only the jobs that suit his or her interests. The majority, I
suppose, will spend their careers drawing the designs of others.
Enough, I think, to ask the further question: what kind of social
role are we talking about here? What role will best ensure that when
Neven asks his questions about research in classics there's someone
with the right qualities of mind to engage in a worthy contest of
imaginations with him?

The workshop is on 5 August 2007 and the main conference is 6 - 11 August.
I can't promise that you are going to find a solution you can just
drop into a project to solve the problem but you will find the very
latest thinking on how to work towards the sort of flexibility that
you are seeking.
If you are interested in cutting edge markup technology the Extreme

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 180 (180)

A new 100+ million word corpus of American English (1920s-2000s) is now
freely available at:
       <a href="http://corpus.byu.edu/time/">http://corpus.byu.edu/time/</a>
The corpus is based on more than 275,000 articles in TIME magazine from
1923 to 2006, and it contains articles on a wide range of topics -
domestic and international, sports, financial, cultural, entertainment,
personal interest, etc.
The architecture and interface is similar to the one that we have
created for our version of the British National Corpus (see
<a href="http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc">http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc</a>), and it allows users to:
-- Find the frequency of particular words, phrases, substrings
(prefixes, suffixes, roots) in each decade from the 1920s-2000s. Users
can also limit the results by frequency in any set of years or decades.
They can also see charts that show the totals for all matching strings
in each decade (1920s-2000s), as well as each year within a given
decade.
-- Study changes in syntax since the 1920s. The corpus has been tagged
for part of speech with CLAWS (the same tagger used for the BNC), and
users can easily carry out searches like the following (from among
endless possibilities): changes in the overall frequency of "going + to
+ V", or "end up V-ing", or preposition stranding (e.g. "[VV*] with ."),
or phrasal verbs (1920s-1940s vs 1980s-2000s).
-- Look at changes in collocates to investigate semantic shifts during
the past 80 years. Users can find collocates up to 10 words to left or
right of node word, and sort and limit by frequency in any set of years
or decades.
-- As mentioned, the interface is designed to easily permit comparisons
between different sets of decades or years. For example, with one simple
query users could find words ending in -dom that are much more frequent
1920s-40s than 1980s-1990s, nouns occurring with "hard" in 1940s-50s but
not in the 1960s, adjectives that are more common 2003-06 than 2000-02,
or phrasal verbs whose usage increases markedly after the 1950s, etc.
-- Users can easily create customized lists (semantically-related words,
specialized part of speech category, morphologically-related words,
etc), and then use these lists directly as part of the query syntax.

Dear Willard and HUMANIST:
At 05:32 AM 6/24/2007, Desmond Schmidt writes a paragraph which gets
close to the core of the problem raised by Neven, I think:
[deleted quotation]This is an apt analogy, except what might have happened over the
course of that century was that the reader of the printed book
emerged, displacing the readers of manuscripts in the considerations
of the printers. It wasn't a mistake as much as it was an evolution.
To Gutenberg, having the red as well as the black ink on the page
might have been terribly important because he knew it was important
to his audience, if only as a proof of concept: "We can also have
colors". A hundred years later, however, readers and collectors of
books had decided that to demand a printed book with any more than
"pro forma" gestures at manuscript facsimile (the "form" of such
efforts being bounded implicitly by what was practicable in print
technologies) was simply beside the point.
A similar evolution is now underway with electronic media -- which is
why the "use case" is both so important, and so difficult. In short
(to recall an earlier thread), it's not just software that "spirals"
in its development, it's the expectations, wishes and abilities of
users themselves.
[deleted quotation]This is an interesting statement that invokes long arguments that
many readers of HUMANIST can trace better than I can. Even if
accepted, it raises the issue of how best to represent many as one.
The most devoted user of the apparatus criticus in a print edition
will not, I hope, argue that such an interface is the best that can
be imagined.
[deleted quotation]I would emend this only to say not "markup" but "current markup-based systems".
And use this opportunity to plug next month's meetings in Montreal --
ah, but I see Patrick already has:

[deleted quotation]It's not so much anti-intellectualism as it is that commercial
technology seems more efficient.  Why spend money on text encoding
and analysis when Google will do it for free (well, as long as we

ability to seach the full text of many of the books its sells
online.  The threat is that the added value of specialization

[deleted quotation]I tend to think of technology as a kind of trade-off between one form
of knowledge and another.  Two examples:  with the ubiquity of
computers in schools, students are becoming less proficient in
handwriting.  I attended college in the mid-80s when most students
were still using typewriters.   The process of writing was very
different then, and at the risk of sounding like Sven Birkerts I
think students produce different papers today.  They eventually learn
to use cut-and-paste responsibly, but the experience of preparing
paper drafts with pencil and paper before committing them to a typed
draft has obviated a certain kind of attentiveness to text.  But it
is true that technology has occasioned new perspectives on text.  To
see things in a new way is to forget the old way.  The other is
starting a fire.  Anyone who has backpacked in the wilderness knows
how helpless he or she becomes when the high-tech camp stove won't
light and the matches are wet.  Palaeolithic man knew stuff we have
forgot.
As I remember from my reading of Heidegger, technology is part of
humanity's Being.  Avoiding it or reversing it would be to deny who
we are.  To be fully human is to reflect constantly on our Being,
including the ontological effects of technology.

Subject: dramaturgies of difference
Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2007 12:38:59 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 186 (186)

In the conclusion to an important book from which I quoted recently,
Deep Time of the Media, Siegfried Zielinski argues that "Cultivating
dramaturgies of difference is an effective remedy against the
increasing ergonomization of the technical media world that is taking
place under the banner of ostensible linear progress" (p. 259). In
the 1990s, he notes, the aim was to make the human-machine boundary
invisible, so that one would be unaware of the computing involved --
unaware of the fact of the algorithms behind the virtual reality of
images and sounds; unaware of the transition from actual to virtual;
unaware that one is dealing with a prestructured, calculated
construction. Zielinsky extends Berthold Brecht's argument in his
Short Organum for the Theatre (1948) that we require a dramatic art
which does not invite its audience to illusion and catharsis but to
continue thinking during the pleasure of theatrical experience.
Senses and reason are not opposites by this view but forces engaged
with each other in producing art. Zielinski's plea is for a
comparable Organum of the Interface. (His first attempt is an essay
with Nils Roeller, "On the difficulty to think twofold in one", in
Sciences of the Interface, ed. Diebner, Druckery and Weibel, Genista
Verlag, Tuebingen, <a href="http://genista.de/shop/i26.html">http://genista.de/shop/i26.html</a>.)
  From the world of contemporary art he pulls Perry Hoberman's
Cathartic User Interface, an installation in which the audience is
invited to throw balls at computer keyboards, as one would throw
balls at tin cans or some such thing at a fairground sideshow. But
Hoberman's installation rewards the successful throw not with a prize
outside the game but with a technical image showing the keyboard,
error messages, satirical distortions of interface graphics, faces of
computer industry agents. No catharsis, rather frustration. Zielinski
concludes: "The only effective form of intervention in this world is
to learn its laws of operation and try to undermine or overrun them.
One has to give up being a player at a fairground sideshow and become
an operator within the technical world where one can work on
developing alternatives." Or as I say, throw off the straitjacket of
the end-user and become and end-maker!
The dramaturgy of computational difference is what I've called
"modelling", with the difference that the yearning is not back toward
some object of study but is itself a work of art. Not only a
born-digital work but a digitally awakened and aware work.

Several initiatives have been launched in the area of Computational
Linguistics, Language Resources and Knowledge Representation both at
the national and international level aiming at the development of
resources and tools. Unfortunately, there are few initiatives that
integrate these results within eLearning. The situation is slightly
better with respect to the results achieved within Knowledge
Representation since ontologies are being developed which describe
not only the content of the learning material but crucially also its
context and the structure. Furthermore, knowledge representation
techniques and natural language processing play an important role in
improving the adaptivity of learning environments even though they
are not fully exploited yet.
On the other hand, eLearning environments constitute valuable scenarios
to demonstrate the maturity of computational linguistic methods as well
as of natural language technologies and tools. This kind of
task-based evaluation
of resources, methods and tools is a crucial issue for the further
development of language and information technology.
The goal of this workshop is to discuss:
? the use of language and knowledge resources and tools in eLearning;
? requirements on natural language resources, standards, and applications
originating in eLearning activities and environments;
? the expected added value of natural language resources and technology
to learning environments and the learning process;
? strategies and methods for the task based evaluation of Natural Language
Processing applications.
The workshop will bring together computational linguists, language resources
developers, knowledge engineers, researchers involved in technology-enhanced
learning as well as developers of eLearning material, ePublishers and eLearning
practitioners. It will provide a forum for interaction among members of
dierent research communities, and a means for attendees to increase their
knowledge and understanding of the potential of computational resources in
eLearning.

In Humanist 21.113 I referred to Edouard Glissant's geographical
metaphor in Poetics of Relation (Michigan, 1997) but did not quote
what he says. Forgive me for the repetition, but now I'd like to turn
the reference into a question. Here is what he says:
[deleted quotation]I became interested in the effects of native geography on how one
constructs one's various worlds when I encountered the mathematician
David Hilbert's imperial metaphor of the relation of disciplines in
his 1917 lecture, "Axiomatic Thought" (in William Ewald, ed., From
Kant to Hilbert: A Source Book in the Foundations of
Mathematics. Volume II. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996.):
[deleted quotation]In an article in Literary and Linguistic Computing (21.1, 2006) I
pointed to some Australian examples, much closer to the Caribbean
than the European. Does anyone here know of others? Are there British
examples that differ significantly from the continental European, as
one suspects they would? Any Canadian ones other than Northrop Frye's
speculations on the relationship been geographically determined
demography and his people's genius for communication?

Subject: Great Principles of Computing

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 189 (189)

Not long ago I passed on an announcement from the ACM magazine
Ubiquity about an interview conducted with the computer scientist
Peter Denning. In case you missed it, the URL of the interview is
www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/v8i22_denning.html. As some of you
will know, Denning has devoted much of his career to articulating the
principles of his discipline in more or less plain language, for
which he has a gift. The interview holds much of interest for us, as
nearby neighbours who really should have a basic understanding of
computer science and who also worry a fair bit about getting the
respect of older kids on the block. Denning's preoccupation with
whether CS is "a science" may suffer from the belief that there is
such a singular entity -- contrary to much current work in the
history and philosophy of the sciences -- but his effort to
articulate principles is intelligent and so worth the candle.
A spinoff of the effort is the nascent Great Principles of Computing
Project, which Denning discusses in the interview and which may be
found at cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/.

Subject: the day-job
Date: Thu, 28 Jun 2007 07:07:06 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 194 (194)

At the end of his Deep Time of the Media (pp. 278-80), Siegfried
Zielinski draws a parallel between the alchemists' laboratories of
premodern Europe, paid for by the rich and powerful of the day, and
the media laboratories nowadays. Behind the modern research
facilities of today, he writes, lies the hope that the contemporary
sorcerers' apprentices, engineers, programmers and artists will
succeed turning the digital into gold. These facilities are set up to
provide "the future of the information society", but those in them
(i.e. people like us) are not content to do this. Hemmed in by
various expressions of the mandate to be "productive", to give "value
for money", our task, Zielinski writes, is to confront what is
possible with its own dimensions of impossibility, to render the
possible more vital and worthy of investment. The experiment cannot
really fail, though our coin is the impossible: as with the
alchemists, we humanists embark on projects of such significance that
there is honour in failure.
Earlier Zielinski quotes the Polish artist and writer, Bruno Schulz:
"If art is only supposed to confirm what has been determined for as
long as anyone can remember, then one doesn't need it. Its role is to
be a probe that is let down into the unknown. The artist is a device
that registers processes taking place in the depths where values are
created." The same could be said of us (though one would want to
check the original German, from Die Wirklichkeit ist Schatten des
Wortes, 1992, p. 92, which I promise to do as soon as the one-clicked
book arrives).
The places of work that we need require, Zielinski goes on to note,
not only the generous host or patron, as of old, but also the guest
for whom artistic praxis with and in media worlds is more than a
cleverly packaged affirmation of what we already know, the guest who
understands the invitation to experiment as a call to continue
working on the impossibility of the perfect interface (for which he
cites Empedocles' model of perception). "The willingness to engage in
wasteful activity oneself is the least this economy should demand of
its guests; such willingness is also the trick that makes it work."
"Artistic praxis on the Internet is superfluous", like the strange
phenomena of bioluminescence with which Deep Media of Time begins.
"Those who can afford this superfluity  earn their living offline or
through a second nonartistic identity in the form of productive work
in the Net."  What they do in the long haul that counts the most is what they
give away, with no expectation of reward (though one does hope from
time to time :-.).
"As a further seriously wasteful activity, artistic praxis on the Net
may have a brilliant future."

You may also be interested in the preconference 
"International Workshop on Markup of Overlapping 
Structures" (<a href="http://www.extrememarkup.com/overlap/index.html">http://www.extrememarkup.com/overlap/index.html</a>).
Extreme is an open marketplace of theories about 
markup and all the things that they support or 
that support them: the difficult cases in 
publishing, linguistics, transformation, 
searching, indexing, and storage and retrieval. 
At Extreme, markup enthusiasts gather each year 
to trade in ideas, not to convince management to 
buy new stuff. At Extreme we push the edges of markup theory & practice.

ICHIM07 - International Cultural Heritage Informatics Meetings
Toronto, October 24-26, 2007
<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/ichim07/">http://www.archimuse.com/ichim07/</a>
** The preliminary program for ICHIM07 is now on-line. **
Thanks once again goes to the Program Committee who helped review
proposals and recommend selections. Speakers are coming from 20
countries around the world to present their work at the only
conference at which senior policy makers from around the world gather
with technology practitioners, researchers, information designers and
the staffs of cultural repositories - libraries, archives and museums
- to imagine and direct informatics services for culture and heritage
knowledge.
** Briefing Opportunities still available. **
If you have a project you would like to tell others about, there is
still a chance to feature your work. Briefing proposals will be
accepted until June 30, 2007. Make your proposal on-line at
<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/ichim07/papers/ichim07.proposal.form.html">http://www.archimuse.com/ichim07/papers/ichim07.proposal.form.html</a>
** Register Online **
We're looking forward to having ICHIM back in North America -- we
haven't met on this side of the Atlantic since 1999. Our facility,
the MaRS Centre at the University of Toronto, will be great [no hotel
tech to deal with!, but it has one down-side: we have to limit
registration because of the capacity of the auditorium. That will
mean a more closely knit group and a better chance for conversations.

REPORT ON CURRENT ISSUES IN HIGHER ED IT
The report of the 2007 EDUCAUSE Current Issues in higher education
information technology is now available online. The survey, now in its
eighth year, asks "campus information technology leaders to rate the
most critical IT challenges facing them, their campuses, and/or their
systems." As it has been in five previous years, funding was ranked as
the number one IT issue. Included in the top ten issues listed were
faculty development, support, and training (number 6) and
course/learning management systems (number 9). The report and related
readings are available at <a href="http://www.educause.edu/2007IssuesResources">http://www.educause.edu/2007IssuesResources</a>.
EDUCAUSE is a nonprofit association whose mission is to advance higher
education by promoting the intelligent use of information technology.
The current membership comprises more than 1,900 colleges,
universities, and educational organizations, including 200
corporations, with 15,000 active members. EDUCAUSE has offices in

PROPOSED SOLUTION TO "BROKEN" COLLEGE TEXTBOOK MARKET
"Most debates over high textbook prices devolve into a blame game . . .
Publishers go after excessive profits, bookstores stock too few used
books, professors ignore prices and switch books on a whim, colleges
fail to guide their faculty members, and students are not smart
shoppers. Such claims are unproductive, the [Education Advisory
Committee on Student Financial Assistance] says, though it sides more
with students than with publishers." [The Chronicle of Higher
Education, June 1, 2007]
After a yearlong study, the Committee, an independent panel that
advises the U.S. Congress on student aid policy, has released "Turn the
Page: Making College Textbooks More Affordable," a report that
addresses the problem of rising prices of college textbooks. Long-term
solutions would entail an "infrastructure of technology and support
services with which institutions, students, faculty, bookstores,
publishers, and other content providers can interact efficiently. This
infrastructure would consist of a transaction and rights clearinghouse,
numerous marketplace Web applications, and hosted infrastructure
resources. . . . The hosted infrastructure would ensure that all
systems interface, support a registry of millions of learning items,
provide marketplace services to thousands of campuses and millions of
users, and process hundreds of millions of transactions for both
fee-based and no-cost content."

HUMOR IN ONLINE CLASSES
        
"A recently published study examined the intentional use of humor in
two otherwise identical sections of an online psychology class . . .
Statistical comparisons at the end of the semester showed no difference
in final grades between sections, but did show that students in the
'humor-enhanced' section earned more participation points by more
frequent participation in online discussions. Students in the
'humor-enhanced' section used the interactive class features more
(including email and discussions), and were more likely to reply to
other student's questions in the discussions."
In "Using Humor in Online Classes" (EDUCATOR'S VOICE), Gail E. Krovitz
presents some tips and cautions for instructors who are considering
incorporating humor into their online classes. The article is available

Subject: geographical models?
Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2007 08:33:12 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 200 (200)

In Humanist 21.113 I referred to Edouard Glissant's geographical
metaphor in Poetics of Relation (Michigan, 1997) but did not quote
what he says. Forgive me for the repetition, but now I'd like to turn
the reference into a question. Here is what he says:
[deleted quotation]I became interested in the effects of native geography on how one
constructs one's various worlds when I encountered the mathematician
David Hilbert's imperial metaphor of the relation of disciplines in
his 1917 lecture, "Axiomatic Thought" (in William Ewald, ed., From
Kant to Hilbert: A Source Book in the Foundations of
Mathematics. Volume II. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996.):
[deleted quotation]In an article in Literary and Linguistic Computing (21.1, 2006) I
pointed to some Australian examples, much closer to the Caribbean
than the European. Does anyone here know of others? Are there British
examples that differ significantly from the continental European, as
one suspects they would? Any Canadian ones other than Northrop Frye's
speculations on the relationship been geographically determined
demography and his people's genius for communication?

====================================================================
Scope
-----
The workshop ``Methods for Modalities'' (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
and tools based on modal logics. Here the term ``modal logics'' is
conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.
To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a
number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations
aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions of
system demonstrations.
We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers
and posters, especially for experimental and prototypical software tools
which are related to modal logics.
More information about the previous editions can be found at
                         <a href="http://m4m.loria.fr/">http://m4m.loria.fr/</a>
Paper Submissions
------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers in the following three
categories.
- Regular papers up to 15 pages, describing original results,
work in progress, or future directions of research.
- System descriptions of up to 12 pages, describing new systems or
significant upgrades of existing ones.
- Presentation-only papers, describing work recently published
or submitted (no page limit).  These will not be included in the
proceedings, but pre-prints or post-prints can be made available to
participants.
Submissions should be made via Easychair at the following address:
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/M4M5/">http://www.easychair.org/M4M5/</a>

Subject: RE: 21.144 geographical models: the Netherlands
Date: Tue, 03 Jul 2007 06:53:17 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 202 (202)

Dear Willard and others,
If you can bear with me a bit longer :  just a further note on what I
wrote in great haste on Saturday (before running off to the theatre).
In addtion to the typo ("teleration" for "toleration"), I note that the
direct url under which I accessed the pdf-file of Van Iterson's paper
doesn't work now that I try it after distribution on this list. Because
it's a quite interesting paper, let me mention, then, that you can get
to it e.g. via the Research Papers in Economics service at EconPapers
(<a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/dgrumanib/1997008.htm">http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/dgrumanib/1997008.htm</a>)
or the University of Connecticut Econ Dept.'s "Ideas" site
(<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/dgr/umanib/1997008.html">http://ideas.repec.org/p/dgr/umanib/1997008.html</a>).
It is perhaps furthermore useful to mention that this particular
Netherlandish manifestation of a "native geographical model" came
into some international prominence with the rise and fall of the
so-called "polder model" *  in the period of the 1990s through the
first five or so years of the 21st century. ( An obvious reference here
is the book _Exit polder model? : socioeconomic changes in the
Netherlands_, by Lei Delsen [revised and translated from the Dutch.
- Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 2002]. )
* The _OED_'s definition of "polder" being :  "a piece of low-lying
land reclaimed from the sea, a river, etc., and protected by dykes".
The concept of a "polder mentality" is a fairly often-referred-to one
in these parts. It also plays a small part, by the way, in Jared Diamond's
_Collapse : how societies choose to fail or succeed_ (Allen Lane and
Viking, 2005).

Subject: Excerpt on Intentional Software from Technology
Date: Wed, 04 Jul 2007 06:45:12 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 208 (208)

Review (Feb 2007)
Willard,
[...]
Because of the perennial question of tool design, you may be
interested in an article that appeared in the
February 2007 issue of "Technology Review" (published by MIT). Scott
Rosenberg's article is a profile of
Charles Simonyi and Intentional Software. The article is accompanied
a shorter piece by Wade Roush that
explains the principles of Intentional Programming. Some excerpts:
<quote>
With the programmers' help, the domain experts list all the concepts
and definitions the software will need
to encompass. [...] each action the software must carry out is stored
in a uniform format, an "intentional
tree". Intentional trees have the advantage of being visually simple
but logically comprehensive, which
means they can be manipulated, revised, and "projected" or
reenvisioned at will. [...] Both the domain
experts and the programmers [...] edit and reedit the projections
until they look right. After that, the
domain code is fed into a "generator" [...] that churns out "target
code" in a language such as C++ or Java
that other computers are able to understand, compile and run. Once
the target code is generated it can't be
turned back into domain code. In that respect, the generator is like
an encryption program that
irreversibly transforms plaintext into ciphertext. However -- and
this is perhaps intentional programming's
biggest advantage -- it's easy to scrap old target code and generate
improved code from scratch. Simply
revise the domain code using the Domain Workbench's Wysiwyg editor
and run it through the generator again.
In most older approaches, even the slightest change in the original
assumptions might require programmers
to sift through millions of lines of code, updating every instance of
a concept, definition, or computation
by hand.

Call for Papers/Participation
Please join us in a workshop on learning and research in Second Life
on October 17, 2007 in Vancouver at Internet Research 8.0 (http://
wiki.aoir.org/index.php?title=About_IR8.0)
Paper Deadline August 15th.
Second Life(R) is a 3d virtual environment created by Linden Lab
which has captured the attentions of researchers and teachers from
around the world from a variety of disciplines.
This workshop aims to improve the understanding of Second Life as a
Learning and Research environment. It will bring 35 researchers
together to collaborate, discuss and workshop diverse topics related
to research and learning in Second Life. We will pursue a full-day
schedule in which participants will discuss their work and interests
on four different topics: learning in Second Life, integrated
learning, the contributions of research to the community and ethical
research methods. How can we better enable learning in this sphere?
How can we better enable research?
As a highlight, Robin Linden will give a talk to the group, and
members of Linden Lab will participate throughout the day.
We encourage researchers to submit papers and short biography to
slworkshop_at_tmttlt.com which will be selected and distributed amongst
participants before the workshop. First invitations will be offered
to those who provide full papers for consideration.
These papers have two purposes: first is to provide a common platform
for understanding our research and teaching and second submitted
papers may be considered for publication in an edited volume being
produced in relation to the workshop, or possibly in peer reviewed
publication derived from the workshop (these are currently under
discussion).
Subsequent invitation will be made based upon research/teaching
statement and biography.  If you are interested in participating,
please send an email containing your information to
slworkshop_at_tmttlt.com.
Decisions will be made by September 1st, barring incident.  There is
a limit of 35 participants at the physical meeting; the event will be
simulcast into Second Life.
We welcome professionals, faculty and graduate students to participate.
This workshop is sponsored by Linden Lab creators of Second Life and
is organized by Jeremy Hunsinger and Aleks Krotoski. Free lunch,
coffee breaks and the room is included in participation.

Hi, we've re-done our UbuRadio stream using ShoutCast. UbuRadio
streams audio selected from the archives of UbuWeb. Currently we're
streaming a few thousands selections and we'll add more soon. You can
listen to Ubu 24/7 on your favorite media player. We had previously
tried with QuickTime rather than ShoutCast, but had numerous
problems. We think this version will be much more successful.
Please give it a listen. I'm sending this announcement to a limited
group to test it out before we annouce more widely. Apologies for any
cross-posting!
While there may be some re-buffering due to net traffic and/or
connection, please let me know if it seems excessive. Send any other
comments as well. Thanks!

WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules are key components of a
model-driven approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy.
VORTE 2007 is the third workshop associated with an EDOC conference that
intends to bring together researchers and practitioners in areas such as
philosophical ontology, enterprise modelling, information systems,
Semantic Web, Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), business rules, and
business processes. The goal of the workshop is to discuss the role that
foundational and domain ontologies play in the conceptual development
and implementation of next generation tools for enterprise computing.
Since enterprise vocabularies and ontologies, as well as business rules
do not exist in isolation but serve to support business processes, THIS
YEAR WE ARE PLANNING TO PUT SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON BUSINESS PROCESS
MODELLING AND MANAGEMENT.
THEMES AND TOPICS
The workshop contributions will be organized along four major thematic
areas, under which the following topics of interest will be included,
but not limited to:
* Conceptual Modelling
- Business Vocabularies, Terminologies, and Taxonomies
- Ontological Approaches to Content and Knowledge Management
- Enterprise Information Integration and Interoperability
- Service Taxonomies and Service Registries (for example, UDDI-related
research)
- Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modelling
- Languages for Conceptual Modelling (for example, OWL and UML)
- Agent-Oriented Conceptual Modelling
* Business Rules and Business Process Semantics
- Semantic Web Services
- Service Ontologies (for example, research related to OWL-S)
- Business Rule Languages and Components
- Rule-based Approaches to Web Service Policies and Choreographies
- Ontologies for Business Process Management
- Agent-based Business Rule and Process Management
- Business Process Modelling and Execution Languages (for example, BPMN
and BPML)
* Ontologies for Enterprise Computing
- Foundational Ontologies and Enterprise Computing
- Ontological Evaluation of Enterprise Systems
- Ontologies for Interoperability of Enterprise Systems
- Ontology-based Enterprise Architectures
- Ontology-based Software Engineering for Enterprises
- Enterprise Components' Modelling
* Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approaches to Enterprise Computing

Producing a work of electronic literature entails not only practice in
the literary arts but sometimes also the visual, sonic, and the
performative arts; knowledge of computing devices and software
programs; and experience in collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and
hybridity.  In short, electronic literature requires its artists to see
beyond traditional approaches and sensibilities into what best can be
described as visionary landscapes where, as Mark Amerika puts it,
artists "celebrate an interdisciplinary practice from a literary and
writerly perspective that allows for other kinds of practice-based
art-research and knowledge sharing."
To forward the thinking about new approaches and sensibilities in the
media arts, The Electronic Literature Organization and Washington State
University Vancouver's Digital Technology and Culture program are
inviting submissions to the Electronic Literature Organization 2008
Conference to be held from May 29 to June 1, 2008 in Vancouver,
Washington.
"Visionary Landscapes:  Electronic Literature Organization 2008
Conference" is interested in papers that explore forms of digital media
that utilize images, sound, movement, and user interaction as well
as or in lieu of ords and that explore how we read, curate, and
critique such works.  Topics may include:
--       New, non-screen, environments for presenting multimedia writing=
  and
/or electronic literature
--       Research labs and new media projects
--       Strategies for reading electronic literary works
--       Curating digital art
--       Innovative approaches to critiquing electronic literature
--       Emerging technologies for the production of multimedia writing and
/or electronic literature
--       Building audience for new media literary works and writing
--       Digital, literary performances
--       Publishing for print or electronic media connecting literature and
the arts through common archiving and metatag strategies
--       Artistic methods of composition used in intermedia storytelling
(improvisation, collaboration, sample and remix, postproduction art,
codework, hactivism, etc.
In conjunction with the three-day conference, there will be a juried
Media Arts Show.  Along with prizes for the most notable work, selected
artists will be awarded bursaries to attend the conference featured at
the show.  Submission guidelines will be posted beginning August 15,
2007 on the conference website.
The keynote speaker is internationally renown new media artist and
writer, Mark Amerika, named a "Time Magazine 100 Innovator." His
artwork has been exhibited at the Whitney Biennial, the ICA in London,
the Walker Art Center, and the Denver Art Museum and has been the topic
of four retrospectives.  Amerika is also the author of many books,
including his recently published collection of artist writings entitled
META/DATA: A Digital Poetics (The MIT Press), founder of the Alt-X
Network, and publisher of the electronic book review.  He currently
holds the position of Professor of Art and Art History at the
University of Colorado at Boulder.
Deadline for Submissions for Presentations:  November, 30, 2007
Notification of Acceptance:  December 30, 2007
Vancouver, Washington, located in the Pacific Northwest just across the

Date: Sat, 14 Jul 2007 10:16:23 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 217 (217)

Hi all,
we've just deployed the second phase of the steve.museum tagging
experiment, at <a href="http://tagger.steve.museum">http://tagger.steve.museum</a>
the steve tagger (a piece of open-source software) is a key tool in
our IMLS-funded study of the contribution social tagging and
folksonomy can make to on-line access to art collections. throughout
our experiment we'll be varying the interface of the tagger to find
out what encourages tagging, and we'll also be studying the results
of tags, to see if they are:
        - real words (we're using word net)
        - terms from our discipline (we're using the AAT and ULAN)
        - new to the museum (we're comparing to museum documentation)
        - appropriate to the work of art (we're doing term-by-term  review).
we're looking forward to sharing the results of our study with the
community. If you'd like to participate in tagging, please come by.
[it's ok if you don't work in an art museum -- and ok if you do!]
        Go to <a href="http://tagger.steve.museum">http://tagger.steve.museum</a>

UBIQUITY ALERT: SOFTWARE EVOLUTION PATTERN RECOGNITION
       In a little paper called 'Situated Design and Universal Maintenance,"
Authors Yuwei Lin and Enrica Zini describe a
software evolution pattern recognition that was
inspired by the Free/Libre Open Source Software
Development. Lin and Zinie are associated with
ESRC National Centre for E-Social Science,
University of Manchester and Debian GNU/Linux.
They write:
"While reusing and recycling software code and
tools gradually becomes a common practice and
understanding, the discussion on SDUM raises many
key research questions in software development
mainly on how to facilitate cross-boundary
collaboration between diverse actors."

UBIQUITY ALERT: THE MATHEMATICS OF PERSUASIVE COMMUNICATION
Writing from Brussels, Belgium, author Philp Yaffee writes:
The success of an oral presentation
depends on the precision of its structure.
Mathematics is all about precision. It is
therefore not so odd to think that applying some
of the concepts of mathematics to oral
presentations could make them substantially more
effective.=94 And that insight provides the
inspiration of an interesting, insightful, and useful paper.

Friends,
The new issues of Design Research Quarterly is about to appear.
This issue features an important article by Linda Drew titled
"Designing the Interface Between Research, Learning and Teaching."
DRQ is both a quarterly peer-reviewed journal and a membership
bulletin distributed to members of the Design Research Society.
The editor -- Dr. Peter Storkerson -- is developing an exciting new
series of articles for which we now seek submissions.
Best regards,
Ken Friedman

Call for Papers:
Design Research Quarterly
announces a new series of articles:
Case Studies in Research: Knowledge and Inquiry
'we want to hold a discussion
on how research steers theory'
Call for Papers:
Designers use the term 'design' to cover a wide range of
activities and types of problems, and we have many differing,
often incommensurable and opposing models of
design and its theoretical and methodological bases. As a
result, we also have have a history of lively debates over specific
theories. These debates have not been able to resolve
differences.
Many regions of design are not well defined, and in such
situations, researchers can find that apparently straightforward
problems can lead to fundamental questions about the
nature of design, what kinds of philosophical and theoretical
positions that can frame the research and ground the methods,
and their implications with regard to knowledge: what
kinds of knowledge are possible within the frames needed
to do the research.
In short, we want to hold a discussion on how research
steers theory. Our idea is to look at research and theories in
design not primarily as related to subfields per se, but to see
theories as products of research problems themselves: the
topics studied studied and the questions being researched.
Rather than look at abstract problems of research and
theory, we want to present actual problems as case studies.
In this way, we can clarify design by mapping its terrain
of activities and problem types with their fundamental theoretical
and methodological requirements.
Over the next two years, DRQ will collect and publish
articles on these topics and replies to those articles, using
its regular publication schedule to build a discussion. If you
have an interest or idea for an article or other submission,
please contact the editor, Peter Storkerson.

Topics:
We seek papers that explore issues including:
- ontological and epistemological implications or require-
ments of a research problem
- status of knowledge, its bases and levels of certainty
- conflicts between the knowledge that is possible in a
given situation and the research goals.
-how research fits into fundamental paradigms: scien-
tific, humanist, phenomenological, pragmatic, etc., and
how those approaches compare in their strengths and
weaknesses
- working across the boundaries of humanism and science:
the extent to which a research problem requires use
of more than one basic philosophical frame and how different
frames can be reconciled

Subject: Dialogue Mapping in Rationale
Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2007 06:40:13 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 224 (224)

Austhink has recently released a new update (1.4) to Rationale, its
argument mapping software.
A major difference between this and previous versions is that it can
incorporate images into maps.
With images, Rationale can be useful deployed to support a range of
activities beyond its core activities of hierarchical grouping, basic
reasoning, and advanced ("analytic") reasoning.
So for example it now has a set of templates supporting "Dialogue
Mapping".  This activity, based on a methodology known as IBIS, is a
more free-form sort of inquiry into a issue, especially so-called
"wicked" problems.
For more information about dialogue mapping, see the Cognexus website
(<<a href="http://www.cognexus.org">http://www.cognexus.org</a>>)

Subject: parallel relations
Date: Sun, 22 Jul 2007 08:04:29 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 228 (228)

Michael Morange, in "Physics, biology and
history" (Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 32.2,
2007, pp. 107-12), briefly tells the story of the
changing relations between physics and biology
from the genesis of the latter discipline
(baptised as such in 1802) to the present. Much
here sounds familiar in outline to practitioners
of humanities computing and so gives us more raw
material for our strategic arguments.
As Morange tells this story, biology arose
largely out of vitalism, or the notion "that the
properties of organisms could not be explained
except by the existence of a vital force,
irreducible to physics or chemistry". Vitalism,
which had begun about a century earlier, was a
reaction against the prevailing attempt "to
explain the functions of organisms in terms of
the simple mechanistic devices known at that
time" (p. 107). Though much reviled, vitalism was
highly influential on biological thinking of the
19C. As a movement it was quite heterogeneous,
including both spiritualists and scientists
"simply cautious in the application of the models
of physics to phenomena specific to life" (p.
108). The application of such models swept the
field with the huge successes of physics up to
the middle of the 20C. Philosophers of science in
the Vienna Circle supported the foundation of all
science on physics -- thus the birth of
"molecular biology" (named by Waren Weaver in
1938), likewise hugely successful and even more ambitious:
[deleted quotation]The reductionism that dissolves biological facts
into various physio-chemical components, or
explains biology wholly in such terms, ran into
serious trouble, however. This trouble became
easier to notice, perhaps, once physics (in its
present form) had peaked. Robert Rosen, in "The
Schrdinger Question, What is Life?" (Essays on
Life Itself, Columbia Univ Press, 2000), notes
Einstein's remark to Leo Szilard, "One can best
feel in dealing with living things how primitive
physics still is" (p. 7), then goes on to work
out in detail Schrdinger's attempt to work
toward a "new physics" adequate to life itself.
Morange argues that physicists are these days
much more collaborative with biologists: it has
become increasingly difficult to do creative work
in the field, so physicists are looking for possibilities elsewhere.
In contemplating the history of the relations
between physics and biology, what can be learned
of value to the relations between computing and
the humanities. The phrasing of the question
suggests an analogical connection, physics to
biology as computing to the humanities, and so
raises the further question of how strong this
analogy is. But, I think, if we are honest with
ourselves there is a further, much more perilous
question. As Marilyn Strathern puts it in
"Interdisciplinarity: some models from the human
sciences", Interdisciplinary Science Reviews
32.2, p. 126, "is the connection one of analogy
(how language is being used) or is the connection
an organic, that is a genetic, one (a
demonstrable kinship)?" Is biology more of a friend
to us than physics? More *than* a friend?
Comments?

NOW!
For further information on: The FLOSSCom project:

The European Union funded FLOSSCom research project is investigating
Free / Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities as learning
environments. The project aims to identify principles of FLOSS
communities that could be transferred to educational settings, e.g. how
the community model could help to improve education.
FLOSS communities might be described as one of the best examples of open
and free education, where thousands of individuals, from very different
educational backgrounds and geographic areas, work together in project
groups developing and improving new or existing systems (project work &
learning).
Translated to education this would mean that every citizen would be able
to learn at no charge and throughout their life. In FLOSS communities
one can find up to date learning resources that are provided by the
community for the community and embedded in a large support network;
provided voluntarily by the community members in a collaborative manner.
Trying to explore and transfer the success factors of these kinds of
communities to formal education is the objective of the FLOSSCom
project. The FLOSSCom project consists of partners from 4 European
countries (Greece, Portugal, Netherlands and United Kingdom) and is
supported by the European Commission's Minerva Programme in education.
The project will run a 'Virtual and On-Campus Summer University'
starting at the beginning of July. The Summer University is a 12 week
open access session with the objective of developing a toolkit on
'Learning the Open Source Way'.
The summer university will be conducted as a joint event bringing in as
a 'special guest' the Ubuntu community -- The world's famous Linux
distribution with a community of 320.000 enthusiasts!
We especially encourage students to take the chance and engage with
experts throughout the globe. We ask everyone to feel free to bring in
their knowledge, thoughts and energy, without any fees or enrolment
criteria. The invitation is open to learners who have no, little or a
great deal of experience with FLOSS communities.
As a reward for their contribution, 10 students that proved a high
commitment to the project at the 'Virtual & On-Campus Summer University'
will be invited to an International Workshop in Portugal taking place in
summer 2008! The FLOSSCom project will cover their travel and
accommodation cost! All those who will participate voluntarily at the
project and help us making the 'Virtual & On-Campus Summer University' a
successful event will receive an e-certificate in the name of all
FLOSSCom project partners of having participated in the project.

Dear Willard,
As a textual critic who has worked on one of the most intractable
manuscripts in the Piers Plowman tradition, I can say only that
humanities computing has been both indispensable to the project and
imperfectly suited to it in its present conception in my
field.  Things are getting better, but my own thought is that we have
a continuous project ahead of us in suiting the computing to the
phenomena--the physics to the biology on your analogy.
Schemes for encoding, for example, get worked out based on some of
the evidence and some of the goals--usually that at the crest of the
bell curve--after which they can be very difficult to modify.  The
elegance of these encoding schemes--essential to their proper
function on the computing side and also to the rigor with which the
encoding can be applied to observed phenomena--can really falsify
what is going on in a manuscript in relation to its text.  Such
problems can only be multiplied if fields other than codico-textual
criticism are taken into account.
We're still a long way from appreciating manuscript evidence in
relation to the text computationally, though we are moving in that
direction now in ways that we were not even three years ago.
Documentation of my project is at:
<a href="http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=10">http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=10</a> .  At the time
it was written, TEI manuscript encoding was not yet supporting study
of the text in direct relation to the codex.  It now seems to be on
that general path.  But a slightly more inductive spirit among those
in computer science would be as salutary as a slightly more deductive
one on the part of those thinking of applying computing to their observations.

Technology and Communication (CATaC'08)
CALL FOR PAPERS
ICTs Bridging Cultures? Theories, Obstacles, Best Practices 6th
International Conference on Cultural Attitudes towards Technology and
Communication (CATaC08)
24-27 June 2008 Universit de Nmes, France Conference languages:
English and French www.catacconference.org
The biennial CATaC conference series  10 years old in 2008!  provides
a premier international forum for current research on how diverse
cultural attitudes shape the implementation and use of information and
communication technologies (ICTs). The conference series brings together
scholars from around the globe who provide diverse cultural and
disciplinary perspectives in their presentations and discussions of the
conference theme and topics (listed below).
Nmes, inhabited by Celts since the 4th ct. B.C.E., became a Gallo-Roman
city in 18 BCE, and is home to some of the best-preserved examples of
Roman engineering and architecture. The Pont de Gard, an aquaduct bridge
across the Gard river, serves as our primary metaphor for CATaC 2008:
ICTs as technologies bridging cultures. Our venue in multi-cultural
Nmes further provides us with a number of cultural experiences and
pleasures unique to the South of France. Finally, CATaC 2008 emphasizes
francophone participation in a number of ways, including, translation
provided for abstracts in French and English, and for questions and
answers following presentations.
Original full papers (especially those which connect theoretical
frameworks with specific examples of cultural values, practices, etc.)
and short papers (e.g. describing current research projects and
preliminary results) are invited.
TOPICS include but are not limited to:
- Language as a core issue in cultural diversity 
with IT: are languages shaping a new IT world?
- CMC as fostering and/or threatening cultural diversity
- Theoretical and practical approaches to 
analyzing "culture" and its impact on the use and implementation of ICTs
- ICTs in the francophone world, including: 
influences of francophone usages globally and cross-cultural comparisons
- Beyond glocalization and homogenization: new 
mixtures of identities and cultures as facilitated by ICTs
- Empowerment and CMC, including issues of 
gender, languages and power (economic, political, social)
- Values, ethics, justice, and ICTS
- Cultural and linguistic diversity and e-learning
SUBMISSIONS
All submissions will be peer reviewed by an international panel of
scholars and researchers. Accepted papers will appear in the conference
proceedings. Submission of a paper implies that it has not been
submitted or published elsewhere. At least one author of each accepted
paper is expected to present the paper at the conference.
Papers may be submitted in either French or English. We strongly
encourage submissions to include abstracts both in French and English,
since accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings with
abstracts in both languages. We will translate abstracts if necessary.
Accepted papers must be formatted according to the conference
proceedings template (download from www.catacconference.org).
The program also includes a panel on culture psychology chaired by
Professor Alexander Voiskounsky.
Submission Schedule:
Full papers (maximum 15 formatted pages) - 14 January 2008
Short and panel papers (3-5 formatted pages) - 21 January 2008
Notification of acceptance  - mid February 2008
Final formatted papers  - 28 February 2008

La srie de confrences biennales CATaC  10 ans en 2008 !  offre une
tribune internationale pour faire l&#x2019;tat de la recherche sur la faon
dont les attitudes culturelles dans leur diversit influencent
l&#x2019;introduction et l&#x2019;utilisation des technologies de l&#x2019;information et de
la communication (TIC). Chaque confrence runit des chercheurs du monde
entier qui apportent des perspectives culturelles et disciplinaires
diversifies, tant dans leurs communications que dans les discussions
sur les thmes abords dans le colloque (cf. liste ci-dessous).
Ville celte depuis le 4e s. av. J.-C., devenue gallo-romaine en 18 av.
J.-C., Nmes regroupe un certain nombre de vestiges parmi les mieux
protgs de l&#x2019;architecture et de l&#x2019;ingnierie romaine. Le Pont du Gard,
aqueduc qui traverse la rivire Gard, sera notre mtaphore principale
pour CATaC 2008: les TIC tablissent des ponts entre les cultures. Faire
de Nmes le lieu de cet vnement sera l&#x2019;occasion d&#x2019;expriences
culturelles qui font le charme du Sud de la France. Enfin, CATaC 2008
mettra l&#x2019;accent sur la participation francophone, notamment par la
traduction dans les deux langues de tous les rsums et par la
traduction des questions et rponses  l&#x2019;issue des prsentations.
Des propositions originales sont attendues, en version longue
(concernant en particulier des modles thoriques, en relation avec des
exemples illustrant valeurs culturelles, pratiques, etc.), ou en version
courte (ex. description de recherches en cours ou de rsultats
prliminaires)
THMES abords (liste non exclusive):
- Le langage comme question centrale pour la 
diversit culturelle des TIC: les langues 
faonnent-elles un nouveau monde technologique?

Subject: explanation and prediction
Date: Tue, 24 Jul 2007 07:07:23 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 236 (236)

In our work, when we attempt to describe the significance of results 
we believe to be reliable, can we ever say that our procedures 
*predict* something or other that has yet to happen or that we have 
yet to test, or are we constrained only to say that these results 
*explain* what we have seen or tested? It seems to me that unhelpful 
cultural baggage (chiefly physics as understood by the Vienna Circle 
et al) privileges the former to such a degree, as the real arbiter of 
theory, that we're unwisely tempted to go for the more prestigious 
alternative without asking what we mean by this. In a weak sense, if 
we say that X may happen under conditions A, B and C, and then it 
does, we can say that we've predicted it, but such usage doesn't mean 
much by itself and blurs dangerously into the stronger sense normal 
to the physical sciences, that X will happen under those conditions. 
Again it may help at this juncture to consider older fields in which 
prediction in the strong sense is simply not on, in which theories 
are for explaining, not for predicting. Biology would seem to be one 
of these. Very good in this regard is an article by Michael Scriven, 
"Explanation and Prediction in Evolutionary Theory", Science NS 
130.3374 (28 August 1959): 477-482. It's in JSTOR.

Willard,
Given the recent attention to the relation between physics and biology and
the possible analogous situation of humanities computing, you may perhaps
be interested in noting that during the 1950s, French biologist Boris
Rybak explored similar territory. In a number of reviews he made the point
that research is a psycho-manual affair, i.e. it involves both brain and
hand.
<quote>
La recherche scientifique est une mobilisation psycho-manuelle constante
du chercheur; dans ces conditions les notions meme de pratique et de
theorique deviennent de moins en moins tranchees.
</quote>
He is quite eloquent on the place of the hands on nature of our
involvement in the production of knowledge:
<quote>
Cette consience, prolongee par un organe polyvalent, la main, fait que non
seulement <i>Homo sapiens</i> est capable d'une activite reflechie, qui le
mene a poser notamment le probleme de sa signification et de celle du
monde, mais aussi d'une activite creactrice concrete.
</quote>
The quotations are from a selection of reviews published under the title
_Anachroniques_ (1962).

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 238 (238)

In Humanist 21.168 Norman Hinton quotes me quoting Marilyn Strathern, 
then comments:
[deleted quotation]He's right, of course. Perhaps Strathern should have said something
more like this: "is the connection one of analogy, made only in
language, or an organic, that is a genetic one, existing in nature as
well?" Yet even so, my fumbling attempt to do better also raises at
least one objection. An analogy speaks not to things but to a
relationship, or perhaps better, to a relating of things. Is a
relationship, or a relating, *only* in language?
Sometimes surely it is a matter of statement only, or at least far
from the organic, genetic sort: apples are to oranges as chalk is to
cheese. Sometimes, in the classic example from Kepler, the
relationship is much closer:  as the sun radiates light, so it
governs planetary motion. Or Francis Bacon's: "Men fear death as
children fear to go in the dark". Some analogies are weak, others
strong. The point seems to be what can be learned from them, how far
they can be pressed before the differences overpower the
similarities. When an analogy is very strong, do we detect a
connection that lasts, that will continue to yield, as Bacon's does
to this day? Are we detecting something "in nature"? And then one
must ask, I suppose: "the nature of what?"
The question at which I was hinting in 21.166 was this: do we in
humanities computing have a closer relationship to biology than to
physics because our focus is on phenomena of living entities rather
than on inert matter? Or is there a better question I should be asking?
Yours,
WM

Subject: 21.133 two threats
Date: Wed, 25 Jul 2007 06:52:49 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 245 (245)

Dear Willard,
In the recent thread conducted under the rubric of "two threats" Mark
Wolff pointed towards Heidegger's thoughts about technology as an
enframing. The allusion to the philosopher sparked for me the recollection
of this passage from Australian writer, Gay Bilson, who in introducing a
section of <I>Plenty: Digressions on Food</I> quotes Octavio Paz.
<quote>
Octavio Paz, in an essay in his collection Convergences, wrote about
'seeing and using'. He suggested that craftsmanship 'in its perpetual
movement back and forth between beauty and utility, pleasure and service
... teaches us lessons in sociability'. He wrote of the 'rationality' of
industrial design, the impersonal uniformity. The handmade bowl is, by his
definition, already sociable. So too is food prepared with discrimination
and offered at the domestic table.
</quote>
Note that the origin of the object does not determine its being imbued
with the sociable. Use does. Industry is quite capable of producing the
mock-handmade.
I quote the passage here not so much as a reminder of the importance of
the social to any disciplinary enterprise than as a worthy recollection of
the place of pleasure in intellectual work.

Subject: theory as theft
Date: Thu, 26 Jul 2007 15:43:18 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 248 (248)

In "Some Random Thoughts about Chaos and Some Chaotic Thoughts about
Randomness", Robert Rosen quotes Sir Arthur Eddington on the concept
of "free information" -- information that is well known and
dependable but not derivable from what you're looking at without
considerable uncertainty. "A pure observer cannot obtain free
information", Eddington writes in his book Fundamental Theory (1946).
But an actual researcher is a human being "and therefore an
inveterate theorist". He or she will likely proceed by stealing
whatever free information comes to hand and substituting it for his
or her uncertain observations. Nothing terribly surprising here, but
as Rosen remarks, the tacit identification of theory with the
stealing of free information, to which the pure (and quite unreal)
observer is not entitled, "is as good a way of characterizing theory
as I have ever found... it has to do not so much with data but with
the extrapolability of data; it pertains to similitude". It is the
Promethean act of stealing in order to build, of taking great risks
in order to progress, of thwarting old Nobodaddy to bring about a
permanent change in how things are done.
Eddington was, of course, speaking about physicists, but I think we
can steal this bit of intellectual stuff and be the better for it, don't you?
Yours,

Willard, a number of approaches in social sciences gave up competing
with scientific procedures and theory building. Denzin's 'thick
description' is well known: "'A thick description is one that goes
beyond the mere or bare reporting on an act (that is, that individual
A did B). This is a thin description.... A thick description
describes and probes the intentions, motives, meanings, context,
situations, and circumstances of action' (p.39).
"Thick description replaces thin description. Prediction becomes
interpretation. Explanation in terms of general laws is not sought".

ELECTRONIC CORPORA OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES
International Conference
Prague (Czech Republic), November 16-17th, 2007
<a href="http://enlil.ff.cuni.cz/ecal/">http://enlil.ff.cuni.cz/ecal/</a>
CALL FOR PAPERS
*** APOLOGIES FOR MULTIPLE POSTINGS ***
* AIMS OF CONFERENCE
Electronic corpora of ancient languages offer
important information about the culture and history
of ancient civilizations, but at the same time
they constitute a valuable source of linguistic
information. The scholarly community is
increasingly aware of the importance of computer-aided
analysis of these corpora, and of the rewards it
can bring. The construction of electronic corpora
for ancient languages is a complex task. Many
more pieces of information have to be taken into
account than for living languages, e.g. the
artefact bearing the text, lacunae, level of restoration,
etc. The electronic corpora can be enriched with
links to images, annotations, and other secondary
sources. The annotations should deal with matters
such as textual damage, possible variant
readings, etc., as well as with many features specific to ancient languages.
Recent years have witnessed a considerable
increase in electronic corpus construction for ancient
languages, with the involvement of many
institutions across the world. The time is ripe to see
whether the experiences of scholars working on
such projects can profitably be shared.
* SUBMISSIONS
We invite submissions on all aspects of the
construction of corpora of ancient languages, as well
as on their use for different purposes. We
especially welcome submissions on the linguistic use of
these corpora, and their linguistic annotation.
* SUBMISSIONS PROCEDURE
Authors are invited to submit original,
unpublished work on the topic of the conference.
Submission of an abstract is required first, for
the review process. After presentation at the
conference, the papers will be published. They
will be required in final form for publication in
January 2008.
Abstracts in PDF format should be sent to
petr.zemanek_at_ff.cuni.cz not later than September 24th.
* IMPORTANT DATES
September 24th -- Submission deadline for abstracts
October 4th -- Notification of acceptance
November 16th-17th -- Conference held in Prague

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 252 (252)

The Centre for Computing in the Humanities is a department within King's
College London which has the responsibility for its own academic programme and
is also a research centre promoting the appropriate application of computing in
humanities research. In its latter capacity, it is looking for someone to
assist with the technical research development in research projects. The
projects cover a wide range of humanities disciplines, including medieval
studies, history, literature and linguistics, and music, and also include a
number of more general information management projects in both humanities and
the social sciences.
CCH is seeking someone to assist with the technical research development of
research projects:
Project Research Fellow
Full-time, open-ended
Closing date for applications: 10th August 2007
Reference: W2/AAV/123/07
The successful candidate to this position would be required to work with
discipline specialists to analyse a wide variety of humanities materials and to
model them using database and other highly-structured approaches; to design,
write and modify programs to search, query, retrieve and display them; and to
collaborate in the creation of integrated web-based interfaces to publish them.
Experience in design and building environments powered by relational database
technologies is essential.  The department uses primarily Java and J2EE
technologies to publish database materials on the web, and experience with
these technologies is also critical.  Familiarity with standards-compliant
XHTML and CSS and issues around accessibility is highly desirable, as is

[deleted quotation]Willard,
This is a very tricky area, certainly for a non-philosopher-of-science
like me.
I enjoyed Suzana's interesting reaction, and really dare not put
forward any comments of my own.
Still -- it occurred to me that if one's really interested in exploring
the whole matter further, one would do well to have look at all
the (in my opinion sensible) stuff Mary Hesse has written, since
the sixties, on explanation and prediction. A good start might be
her _Revolutions and reconstructions in the philosophy of science_,
a collection published in 1980.
Just a friendly suggestion. I'm sure that others better enlightened
than myself can offer more targeted ones.
Regarding sociology and economics, one could have a look at the
recent (and fairly technical) :
Michael Hechter, Hyojoung Kim and Justin Baer, "Prediction versus
explanation in the measurement of values", _European sociological
review_ 21.2 (2005), p.91-108.

It's good to know that social scientists have given up imitating the
natural scientists in their procedures and theory-building, as Suzana
Sukovic notes in Humanist 21.171, and esp good to have the reference
to Denzin's notion of "thick description" (taken from Clifford
Geertz, I assume). But my point was that an understanding of how the
terms "prediction" and "description" play out across the disciplines,
beginning with physics, proceeding on to biology (where my sights are
currently fixed), medicine, the social sciences and then the
humanities, is helpful not only to correct or clarify the claims some
computing humanists may make but also to work out where humanities
computing fits in, from whom it might borrow, what comes along with
borrowed vocabulary, ideas and methods and how to adapt these
borrowed intellectual goods. The history of disciplines shows again
and again how new ones establish themselves by borrowing, then
adapting. We're doing it in any case. How much better if we do what
we do consciously, critically, judiciously.
Comments?

Guattari has an essay 'I am an idea thief', from which you can infer
much the same position, which is remarkably like lautreamont's
thought on plagiarism and the implications of newton's thought
'standing on the shoulder of giants'.   Human thought, and thus
theorizing, steals ceaselessly taking whatever it can from the ideas
we have available to find a way through the question at hand.  On a
more fundamental level, at least one of the practices of research and
theorizing, the maintenance of a 'notebook' or commonplace book in
which you copy the text and thus thought of others into your own
contexts used to be a form of sharing, not stealing.  More and more
though... I suspect people believe that you can own ideas and
information, that information and ideas aren't without value
(capital), and thus stealing them becomes much more problemetized.
The age of 'intellectual property' recreates 'theorizing as stealing'
into violation of a property right instead of as Rosen indicates,
being human.

It is not clear in how you quote from Robert Rosen if the Promethean

UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
FACULTY OF CLASSICS
(Sub-Faculty of Ancient History)
POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP IN E-SCIENCE, IMAGING TECHNOLOGY
AND ANCIENT DOCUMENTS
Further Particulars
1. General Introduction
Funding has been secured through the AHRC-EPSRC-JISC Arts and
Humanities E-Science initiative to appoint a post-doctoral Research
Assistant, for a period of three years from 1 October 2007, to work on
the application of Information Technology (IT) to ancient documents
under the supervision of Professors Alan Bowman FBA, Sir Michael Brady
FRS FREng, and Dr. Melissa Terras (UCL).  The Research Assistantship
will be held in the Faculty of Classics and supported at the Centre for
the Study of Ancient Documents and the Oxford E-Research Centre
(Directors: Dr. Anne Trefethen and Prof. Paul Jeffreys). The initial
salary will be in the range GBP 25,889 - GBP31,840 (Academic Related, Grade
7), according to qualifications and experience.
2. Aims and objectives of the project
The postdoctoral Research Asssistantship is attached to a project which
will develop a networked software system to support the imaging,
documentation, and interpretation of damaged texts from the ancient
world, principally Greek and Latin papyri, inscriptions and writing
tablets. Full details of the project are available electronically from
Professor Bowman on request (alan.bowman_at_classics.ox.ac.uk). The main
focus of the project is to develop a support system by methods of
aiding (by image enhancement), representing and tracking the reader's
developing decipherment and understanding of documents, by iteratively
and progressively facilitating the inclusion of new insights and
conjectures over prolonged periods of study and by a building a
computer-generated, human-readable representation of the range of
possible 'solutions' as well as the contingencies of such possibilities
derived from contextual knowledge or direct perception of the text.
The RA will work in close collaboration with a doctoral student whose
work he/she will help to supervise. The following should be viewed as
indicating the area of work to be undertaken in collaboration with the
doctoral student.
a.	Building an interface to image analysis software developed by
Professors Brady and Bowman for analysis of Latin stilus tablets.
b.	Designing and implementing an interface to the components
described in (a-c), in collaboration with the current JISC-funded VRE
project 'A Virtual Workspace for the Study of Ancient Documents' (PI
Professor Bowman).
c.	Acquiring familiarity with work at Oxford University and
elsewhere on Virtual Research Environments and on the design and
implementation of interfaces to enable scholars to access the system to
be designed and implemented, typically over the Internet.
d.	Developing a decision support system, closely modelled on those
developed in the Department of Engineering Science by Professor Brady
and colleagues;
e.	Incorporating into the decision support system representations
of letter shapes and words in Latin and/or Greek, and associated
knowledge building upon the doctoral work of Dr. Melissa Terras.
f.	Acquiring familiarity with work done in the broader Digital
Humanities and Humanities Computing community regarding the development
of computational tools to aid humanities researchers in undertaking
their complex research tasks
Detailed tasks to be underaken by the RA:
1.	The implementation of a set of image analysis algorithms, the
majority of which have been developed on previous projects led by the
Principal Investigators (PIs);
2.	to enable such algorithms to be applied to images of a range of
ancient documents, either locally or over the internet by a scholar who
may access the system over the Internet and whose resources may not be
in Oxford.
3.	the development of an interface to a software system, which
includes the image analysis algorithms developed in (1), import/display
of a set of images of ancient documents, and the decision support tool
developed by the postgraduate student associated with the project; and
4.	provide documentation on how to use the system as well as
appropriate levels of training and support in its use.
3. Qualifications, Training and Experience.
Essential:
--postgraduate degree, ideally a doctorate, in a subject that has
a substantial computing component (e.g. Computer Science, Engineering,
Mathematics, Physics) OR a postgraduate degree in the humanities,
together with evidence of expertise in programming and Informatics;
--Track record of published work concomitant with the age and
experience of the candidate;
--Evidence of experience in programming in modern computing
languages such as Java, C++, and using internet standards such as XML;
--Evidence of ability to work collaboratively as a member of an
inter-disciplinary team;
--Evidence of interest in Humanities based research, and research
issues.
Desirable.
--Some knowledge or ability to acquire some basic knowledge of
the language of Latin and Greek documents; and
--Experience either of working in image analysis or with images
of ancient documents.
4. Method of application
Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a statement detailing
the applicant's experience, qualifications and suitability for the
post, along with any relevant publications and the names and addresses
of two referees, who should be asked to send their references directly
to the address below by the closing date.

Subject: how to cite software?

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 260 (260)

The Web has clearly affected the kinds of things that get into a
bibliography. In the case of online materials, such as websites, one
gives a URL and a date as a matter of course. If the item is no
longer online, there's the Wayback Machine, <a href="http://www.archive.org/">http://www.archive.org/</a>,
which one assumes (a) will exist in whatever future when someone
wants to follow up on a cited source, and (b) will be known to the
person following the defunct citation. But what about software? Take,
for example, Weka, a collection of machine learning algorithms for
data mining tasks, <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/</a>. Under
"Citing Weka", the website says,
[deleted quotation]Note the date of publication. Two years -- probably at least three if
you count the time in press -- is a long time in the software trade.
But how else will the fine work in Weka ever make it into the
bibliographic citation services? And what does this say about
recognition of software that for perfectly good reasons doesn't have
a manual in print? What does the say about our intellectual objects
as primary contributions to knowledge?
Yours,

I C G L
First International Conference on Global Interoperability
for Language Resources
City University of Hong Kong
Kowloon, Hong Kong
9-11 January 2008
<<a href="http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk">http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk</a>><a href="http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/">http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/</a>
Language resources, including not only corpora but also
lexicons, knowledge bases and ontologies, grammars, etc.
support the development of language processing applications
that are increasingly important to the global society.
Substantial effort has been devoted to the creation of such
resources for the world's major languages over the past
decades, and new projects are developing similar resources
for less widely-used languages. Some standards and best
practices have emerged for representing and linking
language corpora and annotations, efforts such as "Global
WordNet" and the development of framenets in multiple
languages seek to create and link specific lexical and
semantic resources across languages, and there are efforts
to integrate such resources into general ontologies such as
SUMO and to enable common access to ontologies spread across
the World Wide Web. As the need for cross-lingual studies and
applications grows, it is increasingly important to develop
resources in the world's languages that can be compared and
linked, used and analyzed with common software, and that
contain linguistic information for the same or comparable
phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a
"global web" of language resources, wherein, for example,
linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are
inter-linked via the use of common categories, or
categories that are mapped to one another; resources such
as wordnets and framenets are linked not only to versions
in different languages, but also to each other; and common
representations enable analysis and use of resources in
different languages and of different types within available
systems.
The first international conference on Global
Interoperability for Language Resources will bring together
designers, developers, and users of corpora and other
language resources from across the globe, in order to:
o  assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for
     resource representation, annotation, interlinkage, and
     access;
o  consider the requirements for (and obstacles to)
     multi-lingual and multi-modal interoperability and
     standardization;
o  consider the requirements for achieving interoperability
     among multi-lingual resources of different types,
     including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bases,
     ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and frameworks
     that enable their creation and exploitation;
o  consider the ways in which web technologies are and may
     be used to enable resource interoperability and inter-
     linkage;
o  work toward the definition of best practice guidelines
     and standards for language resource representation,
     annotation, and use that will enable interoperability;
o  consider means to map or harmonize linguistic
     information in order to better enable cross-lingual
     studies;
o  provide direction for developers of resources for less
     widely used languages;
o  promote collaboration and cooperation among developers
     of language resources across the globe;
o  consider ways to provide central or distributed access
     to language resources developed throughout the world.
Topics
Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the
following topics:
o  multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources,
     with focus on the mechanisms enabling interoperability;
o  support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in
     systems/frameworks for resource creation, annotation,
     use, and access;
o  existing and proposed standards and best practice guidelines
     for language resources, including standards for linguistic
     annotations at any and all linguistics levels;
o  systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the
     development and exploitation of interoperable language
     resources;
o  evaluation of existing resources, systems and
     frameworks, and/or standards in terms of support for
     interoperability;
o  harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language
     resources, including corpora, wordnets, framenets,
     ontologies, etc.;
o  web-based technologies for resource interoperability,
     inter-linkage, and access;
o  interoperability of ontologies for language processing
     research;
o  support for multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and
     multi-modality.
In addition to full-length paper presentations, the Program Committee
also invites proposals for posters addressing any of the above topics.
Posters describing existing or developing resources or tools that
provide an assessment of needs and/or considerations for interoperability
are especially encouraged.
Proceedings
Accepted papers will be included in conference proceedings,
to be published by City University Press, Hong Kong. A selection
of outstanding conference presentations will be published in a
special issue of the journal "Language Resources and Evaluation".

London
Melissa Terras (University College London)
'Can computers ever read ancient texts?'
Researchers in the Centre of the Study of Ancient Documents, and the
Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford (and now UCL
SLAIS), have been attempting to build a system to aid historians in
reading damaged and deteriorated texts, specifically those from
Vindolanda. But to what extent can computers ever hope to "read"
ancient texts, and how can computers aid (not replace) historians in
propagating readings from hard to read documentary material?
ALL WELCOME
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.

[The question that has been asked is, "Can computers ever read
ancient texts?" --WM]
I would say that the answer is a qualified yes.  As long as you
understand what the translation you are getting is.  The hard part I
would imagine is the OCR of the manuscript texts.  But even with all
the aids we have at this time I don't believe that you could ever
eliminate the human element from translations.

[deleted quotation]The Weka folks undoubtedly would like you to use their (excellent)
free software to advertise their commercial publication, but citing in
this way is not an acceptable practice according to the style guides I
have lying around (which makes sense, since most software is not
associated with a print publication).
For downloaded software, the MLA (for example) recommends the name of
the program, the version number, the date it was downloaded, and the
URL.  Their example, in fact, uses the work of our revered colleague
John Bradley:
*TACT: Text-Analysis Computing Tools*.  Vers. 2.1 gamma.  30 Apr. 1997

(Ah, gopher.  Now that brings back memories!)
The rules are slightly different for software that is published on
some physical medium, but the emphasis remains on the version number
and the date.

Call for papers
Rethinking the Book: Between Text and Para-Text
In their Introduction to A Companion to the History of the Book, Simon
Eliot and Jonathan Rose write that while "literary critics and theorists
feel able to talk about a text as though it were some disembodied
entity, for the book historian the text always takes an embodied form".
The aims and objectives of criticism, exegesis and the history of ideas,
on the one hand, and book history and historical bibliography on the
other are not simply different. As tools for human communication, books
carry meaning through their "text" as much as through their physical
form, and the interaction between the two is the focus of this study. We
invite scholars working on book history to look more deeply into how
this interaction works. Topics that could be considered are physical
form (mise-en-page, typography, format, paper type) and meaning, the
relationship between history of the book and textual editing, "material"
reception/reputation history, the sociology of the text and the idea of
influence/intertextuality, para-text and the material book, the genetic
text and the "biography" of an oeuvre, illustrations and dust jackets.
Note that we welcome abstracts on any Book History related topic.
Please send your proposal (200-300 words) to Christine Lees
(Christine.Lees_at_sas.ac.uk) and Wim Van Mierlo (Wim.Van-Mierlo_at_sas.ac.uk)
before 15 September 2007.
This study day is free and open to postgraduates, academics and
independent scholars with an interest in the History of the Book.

Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants
**********************************
The U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the U.S.
Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) invite applications to
the Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants program. This program is designed
to encourage innovations in the digital humanities. By awarding
relatively low-dollar grants during the planning stages, the goal is to
identify projects that are particularly innovative and have the
potential to make a positive impact on the humanities.  By having IMLS
co-sponsor this grant opportunity with the NEH, our hope is to spark
more collaborations among scholars, librarians, museum officials, and
computer scientists.
Deadlines:  October 16, 2007 & April 2, 2008
The guidelines are available here:
<a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html">http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html</a>
There is one major change in this grant opportunity from last year that
I'd like to emphasize.  Based on feedback from the digital humanities
community, we now have two levels of funding available:
LEVEL I START-UP: Awards of $5000 - $25,000. These are small grants
designed to fund brainstorming sessions, basic research, workshops,
early alpha-level prototypes, and initial planning.
LEVEL II START-UP: Awards of $25,001 - $50,000. These are larger grants
which can be used for more fully-formed projects that are ready to start
the first stage of implementation or the creation of working prototypes.

What, exactly, constitutes a valid, original work? What are the
implications for how we assess and reward creativity? Can a college or
university tap the same sources of innovative talent and energy as
Google or Flickr? What are the risks of permitting or opening up to
this activity?"
In "Dr. Mashup; or, Why Educators Should Learn to Stop Worrying and
Love the Remix" (EDUCAUSE REVIEW, vol. 42, no. 4, July/August 2007, pp.
12-24), Brian Lamb discusses the conditions needed in universities to
enable mashups and other Web 2.0 tools to play a significant role in
education. The article is online at

UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING IN A DIGITAL AGE
"Publishing in the future will look very different than it has looked
in the past. Consumption patterns have already changed dramatically, as
many scholars have increasingly begun to rely on electronic resources
to get information that is useful to their research and teaching.
Transformation on the creation and production sides is taking longer,
but ultimately may have an even more profound impact on the way
scholars work."
The Ithaka report, "University Publishing in a Digital Age" (July 23,
2007), "began as a review of U.S. university presses and their role in
scholarly publishing. It has evolved into a broader assessment of the
importance of publishing to universities." To assess the current state
and future role of university-based scholarly publishing, the report's
authors interviewed a variety of university provosts, press directors,
and librarians from public and private institutions. Based on the
interviewees responses, in the future of university publishing:
        -- Everything must be electronic
        
        -- Scholars will rely on deeply integrated electronic
                research/publishing environments
        -- Multimedia and multi-format delivery will become
                increasingly important
        -- New forms of content will enable new economic models

"[Copy editing is] a special little focus of interest at the moment
because publishers claim it as an important area of added value and
want to demonstrate how much they contribute to the integrity of
scholarly literature through providing it, while the proponents of
self-archiving counter-claim that the author's final version of an
article -- the one which contains all the changes advised or required
by the peer review process -- is a perfectly adequate version to be
deposited in a digital repository for open access purposes." In her
blog, OptimalScholarship, scholarly communication consultant Alma Swan
discusses some studies that examine the value of what publishers
contributed to final versions of scholarly works.

WE THINK: WHY MASS CREATIVITY IS THE NEXT BIG THING (Draft version)
By Charles Leadbeater
<a href="http://www.wethinkthebook.net/home.aspx">http://www.wethinkthebook.net/home.aspx</a>
"We-Think: the power of mass creativity is about what the rise of the
likes of Wikipedia and Youtube, Linux and Craigslist means for the way
we organise ourselves, not just in digital businesses but in schools
and hospitals, cities and mainstream corporations. My argument is that
these new forms of mass, creative collaboration announce the arrival of
a society in which participation will be the key organising idea rather
than consumption and work. People want to be players not just
spectators, part of the action, not on the sidelines."
Leadbeater is making a draft of his book available online prior to
formal publication to allow readers to comment and make suggestions.
[Editor's note: Years ago I came across a study on the importance of
professors' informal conversations in the hall for the exchange of
ideas. Coming across the link to Leadbeater's book made me think on how
much the Web has become a virtual hallway for informally sharing ideas
and resources. Thanks to Seb Schmoller's posting (in his FORTNIGHTLY
MAILING; <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/">http://fm.schmoller.net/</a>) on David Jennings' posting on

Call for Papers for the 43rd International Congress on Medieval Studies, May
8-11, 2008, Kalamazoo, Michigan
The Medieval Academy of America Committee on Electronic Resources invites
submissions to the following sponsored session:
"Digital Media and Peer Review in Medieval Studies"
Medievalists are increasingly turning to digital media both to produce new
types of scholarship such as encoded texts and non-bookish digital projects
(e.g. archives and interactive electronic resources) and to advance and
increase the efficiency of traditional forms of scholarship such as critical
editions.  There is not yet widespread agreement, however, regarding how
this new work should count for academic promotion, and many scholars working
in these new media find that there are few established avenues for getting
their work peer reviewed.  At the same time, we are witnessing rapid and
widespread changes in how we use print texts (e.g. often in scanned,
searchable copies), and many traditional publishers of print journals and
monographs are under enormous financial pressures from declining sales and
print runs, thereby further limiting access to peer review and opportunities
for publication.  How can we, as a community, bring scholarship, publishing,
and the need for peer review into balance?
Please email abstracts (not to exceed 300 words) to Timothy Stinson (
stinson_at_jhu.edu). Please include name, professional/university affiliation,
and contact information.

I expect that like many of you with mid 20C 
origins, I read Erwin Schrdinger's once famous 
little book What is Life? (1944) in my youth and 
then forgot about it -- until reminded recently 
by Robert Rosen's Essays on Life Itself. But for 
those of you who haven't read Schrdinger's book, 
allow me a small bit of background. Schrdinger 
(1887-1961) was an Austrian-Irish theoretical 
physicist whose fame came from his work on 
quantum dynamics. He won the Nobel Prize in 1933 
for a quantum dynamical equation that bears his 
name. (The Wikipedia entries on Schrdinger and 
his equation will fill you in on some details.) 
Anyhow, shortly before the end of WWII, he turned 
his attention to theoretical biology, about which 
by his own admission he knew very little, 
comparatively speaking, and gave a series of 
lectures in Dublin that were published in 1944 
under the title of the book I am recommending. He 
felt, as Einstein had once remarked, that physics 
as we know it is terribly primitive --  that 
although living systems are part of the natural 
world, the science that should be able to include 
them cannot. So he turned to organisms as 
respository of a "new physics". It must have 
taken considerable bravery for someone in his 
position, at the top of his field, so able to get 
an audience (of ca 400 people) and a publisher 
afterwards, but expected to produce goods of the 
highest calibre, to venture into the unknown. But 
he did. This is what he says at the beginning of 
the book after recognizing that experts, as "a 
matter of noblesse oblige", are usually expected 
not to write on any topic of which they are not master:
[deleted quotation]The whole of which Schrdinger spoke may be far 
more complex than he imagined -- though, his 
imagination being what it was, I'd be cautious 
going too far in that direction. It is certainly 
now even fashionable to speak, as Nancy 
Cartwright has brilliantly written, of a "deeply 
dappled" physical world. Yet, I'd think, 
wholeness remains by some kind of reasoning the 
goal by which we operate intellectually, even if 
it never can be achieved. It certainly seems that 
a synthesis of what we're doing with computers is 
squarely on our agenda, and that to achieve it, 
Schrdinger-like bravery is required.

shifting the newspaper publishing paradigm. Mohan
Babu K. explains: "The current paradigm is being
extended into a two-way communication, primarily
by tech-savvy readers who are using Web 2.0
technologies: blogs, wikis, online discussion
boards and forums. Readers are re-broadcasting
the editorials and articles by superimposing
their viewpoints and observations along with the
original. If you were to think about it is a good

of them shaped by an editorial."

<a href="http://www.hb.se/bhs/ith/1-9/">http://www.hb.se/bhs/ith/1-9/</a>
This issue's theme is Electronic Records, and it is guest edited by
Anneli Sundqvist at Mid Sweden University. She writes:
"Information technology has added new dimensions to the concept of
records and to archival practices. For thousands of years the medium for
records creation was stable and physically tangible, and thus the
handling primarily concerned keeping order in a literal sense. Then from
the middle of the 20th century, first microfilm, audio recordings, and
later computer technology, have challenged the foundations of both
practices and principles. The new technology has made an enormous
proliferation of records possible, often in susceptible formats of short
duration. The concept of a record as a fixed entity and of the archive
as a definite assembly of closed records is questioned. This touches
upon the intricate issue of the relation between technology and social
change. All the contributions to this thematic issue of Human IT attend
to the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on
established practices in such various fields as administrative work,
long-term preservation of official documents, and the conservation of
art works."

Subject: CFP: XIIIth Colloquium Hippocraticum
Date: Thu, 09 Aug 2007 07:33:24 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 281 (281)

XIIIth Colloquium Hippocraticum
Call for Papers
What's Hippocratic about the Hippocratics?
The XIIIth triennial Colloquium Hippocraticum will be held at the
University of Texas at Austin August 11th-13th 2008.
The objective of the conference is to bring together scholars and
students of ancient medicine, science and philosophy to advance our
understanding of the compass of the term "Hippocratic". The term is
used primarily to refer to the authors, texts, theories and practices
of the Corpus Hippocraticum, which share a basic scientific outlook
but which are notoriously polemical one with another.  To date most
research has focused on the disparities between treatises and
polemical relationships between authors.  We are soliciting papers
which look more closely for specific commonalities and which identify
clusters of shared theories and practices. We are interested in
considering in what ways, if any, the Corpus as a whole, or at least
the major part of it, can be differentiated from other rationalist
medical theories of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. as
illustrated in, e.g., the theories contained in the Anonymus
Londinensis, the writings of Diokles of Karystos, papyrus fragments
of medicine not duplicated in the Corpus, references to medicine in
non-medical texts.  The main question we hope to address is, "Is the
Corpus the result of a haphazard process of collection of rational
medical treatises or were there criteria for selection that deemed
some rational medicine ineligible for inclusion in the Corpus?"
Examination of these issues could proceed either by intertextual
study of two or more treatises within the Corpus or by comparison of
treatises to works not included in the Corpus (literary, historical
and philosophical as well as medical).  We hope to elicit papers
dealing with theory, therapy, chronology and geographical
provenance.  Papers dealing with the early catalogues of the Corpus
or with later authors who can shed light on this question, such as
Galen, are welcome.  Innovative papers only tangentially related to
the main theme of the Colloquium will also be considered.
The languages of the conference will be English, French, German,
Italian and Spanish.  Proposals of 500-750 words should be sent,
preferably in electronic format, to Lesley Dean-Jones,
ldjones_at_mail.utexas.edu.
Surface mail: Department of Classics, 1 University Station C3400,
University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712, USA.
Deadline: February 8th, 2008.  Authors whose papers are selected for
presentation will be notified by March 15th, 2008.  We particularly
encourage proposals from graduate students and expect to have student
bursaries to offset their expenses.

Request for Proposals-Cooperative Agreements for the National Digital
Newspaper Program (A Partnership between NEH and the Library of

Program Overview

--	Award announcement: June 2008
--	Grant period: 2 years beginning July 2008
NEH is soliciting proposals from institutions to participate in the
National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP). Ultimately, over a period of
approximately 20 years, NDNP will create a national, digital resource of
historically significant newspapers from all the states and U.S.
territories published between 1836 and 1922. This searchable database
will be permanently maintained at the Library of Congress (LC) and be
freely accessible via the Internet. [See the beta prototype Web site,
Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers at
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/">http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/</a> .] An accompanying national
newspaper directory of bibliographic and holdings information on the Web
site will direct users to newspaper titles available in all types of
formats. LC will also digitize and contribute to the NDNP database a
significant number of newspaper pages drawn from its own collections
during the course of this partnership between NEH and the Library.
The NDNP will be implemented in several phases, gradually extending its
chronological coverage.  Since 2005, awards to state projects are
supporting the selection and digitization of titles published in
California, Florida, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Texas,
Utah, and Virginia between 1880 and 1910.  The Endowment intends to fund
projects in all states and U.S. territories provided that sufficient
funds allocated for this purpose are available. One organization within
each U.S. state or territory will receive an award to collaborate with
relevant state partners in this effort. Previously funded projects will
be eligible for continued support to digitize pages from new decades, as
the program increases its chronological span. During this phase of NDNP,
successful applicants will select newspapers-published in their state in
English between 1880 and 1922-and convert, primarily from microfilm,
over a period of two years, approximately 100,000 pages into digital
files, according to the technical guidelines
(<a href="http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/pdf/NDNP_200810TechNotes.pdf">http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/pdf/NDNP_200810TechNotes.pdf</a>) outlined by the
Library of Congress.
NDNP builds on the foundation established by an earlier NEH initiative:
the United States Newspaper Program (USNP). Since 1982, the Endowment
has supported a cooperative, national effort to locate, catalog, and
preserve on microfilm American newspapers published from the 18th
century to the present. NEH has funded newspaper projects in all the
fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands. When completed in 2009, USNP will have provided bibliographic
control to widely scattered newspapers and have preserved on microfilm
(to consistent national standards) selected titles from this vulnerable
corpus. LC has provided technical assistance for the USNP since its
inception.
NEH expects to award two-year cooperative agreements (of up to $400,000
each), depending on the availability of funds. The Guidelines for the
Request for Proposals are located at:
<a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/ndnp.html">http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/ndnp.html</a> . LC*s technical

'A Virtual Research Environment for the Study of Documents and
Manuscripts'
The scholar interpreting an ancient documentary text has a broad range
of relevant electronic tools available; but the interaction is largely
in one direction and the experience is fragmented by the dispersal of
the electronic resources. Decipherment and transcription are scholarly
activities that naturally benefit from shared visualisation and
multiple perspectives, but the potential of ICT to mediate
collaborative investigation has yet to be fully exploited. A VRE for
the Study of Documents and Manuscripts is a two-year JISC funded
project designed to explore these challenges through the construction
of an integrated collaborative environment for the study of ancient
documentary artefacts.

Hello:
We have just started reviewing applications for this position, so please
apply if you are interested.
Best wishes, Natasha Smith
Head, Digital Publishing/Documenting the American South

<a href="http://www.lib.unc.edu/jobs/epa/nc_maps.html">http://www.lib.unc.edu/jobs/epa/nc_maps.html</a>
Position: North Carolina Maps Project Librarian (**Fixed Term
Appointment**)
Available: July 1, 2007
The University of North Carolina seeks a knowledgeable and resourceful
librarian for the position of North Carolina Maps Project Librarian. The
Project Librarian will serve as project manager for "North Carolina Maps," a
three-year digitization project funded by the Library Services and
Technology Act through North Carolina ECHO (Exploring Cultural Heritage
Online). The Library, in collaboration with the North Carolina State
Archives and the Outer Banks History Center, plans to digitize and publish
online a comprehensive selection of early North Carolina Maps. This new
digital collection will become part of an ever-growing library digital
publishing program that includes the internationally renowned Documenting
the American South (<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu">http://docsouth.unc.edu</a>) and is part of the
newly-established Carolina Digital Library.
The Project Librarian will work with staff from the North Carolina
Collection at UNC-Chapel Hill and the two partner repositories, who will

the project. The Project Librarian will oversee the project through all
stages of implementation to its completion, coordinating efforts among
participating departments and repositories, managing the daily operation of
the project and its budget, and maintaining efficient workflow. The Project
Librarian will train and supervise several graduate student research
assistants who will prepare selected documents for digitization, scan page
images, and assign technical and administrative metadata. Preparation of the
selected documents for digitization includes matching maps with existing
catalog records, investigating and resolving bibliographic irregularities,
and identifying conservation work that needs to be done before items are
digitized.
The Project Librarian will be responsible for the production of descriptive
item-level metadata for digital objects to promote searchability and
discovery via locations, names, dates, and subjects. The Project Librarian
will also be responsible for the quality of digital conversion and
conformity with national standards and best practices and oversee the online
publication of materials. The Project Librarian and the CDL staff will
develop the website architecture and design and conduct usability studies to
assess the site interface and functionality. The Project Librarian will work
with North Carolina Collection staff to develop a North Carolina map
cataloging manual, which will serve as a guide for identifying and
describing state maps for use by cultural heritage professionals around the
state. The Project Librarian will also work with the Digital Library staff
on the content synthesis and is responsible for the ongoing refinement of
the Web presentation. The Project Librarian will work closely with other
Library departments and University departments as needed for the successful
and timely completion of the project.

Upcoming Workshops: Getting to know TEI P5 and an Educational
Roundtable (31 October 2007)
              --
The 20th Anniversary Text Encoding Initiative Consortium Members'
Meeting is offering two pre-conference workshops to interested
participants. Both workshops take place on October 31 in McKeldin Library.
I. Getting to know TEI P5 : Everything you wanted to know about TEI
P5 (but were afraid to ask)! [Instructors: Dot Porter and James Cummings]
This day long hands-on workshop will begin with a basic overview of
the TEI Guidelines: the structure of the TEI as a text encoding
system and the major changes from P4 to P5 in the way the TEI is
generated and organised. This full-day workshop runs from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. with a mid-day break for lunch. Fee: $120.00
II. TEI training: "Education Roundtable" [Convenor: Werner Wegstein]
This half-day event offers a platform for instructors to  exchange
ideas and concepts about teaching TEI to different groups of users
(from undergraduates to researchers), at different levels of detail,
using different media and environment (distance teaching vs. a
classroom approach), for different modes of scholarly discource
(dictionaries or scholarly editions), and using different methods
(e.g. Teaching TEI by translation). This half-day workshop will run
from 1:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. The workshop is free, but registration is required.

--       Grant period: 2 years beginning July 2008
NEH is soliciting proposals from institutions to
participate in the National Digital Newspaper
Program (NDNP). Ultimately, over a period of
approximately 20 years, NDNP will create a
national, digital resource of historically
significant newspapers from all the states and
U.S. territories published between 1836 and 1922.
This searchable database will be permanently
maintained at the Library of Congress (LC) and be
freely accessible via the Internet. [See the beta
prototype Web site, Chronicling America: Historic
American Newspapers at
<<a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/">http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/</a>>
An accompanying national newspaper directory of
bibliographic and holdings information on the Web
site will direct users to newspaper titles
available in all types of formats. LC will also
digitize and contribute to the NDNP database a
significant number of newspaper pages drawn from
its own collections during the course of this
partnership between NEH and the Library.
The NDNP will be implemented in several phases,
gradually extending its chronological
coverage.  Current awards to state projects are
supporting the selection and digitization of
newspapers published in California, Florida,
Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Texas,
Utah, and Virginia between 1880 and 1910.  The
Endowment intends to fund projects in all states
and U.S. territories provided that sufficient
funds allocated for this purpose are available.
One organization within each U.S. state or
territory will receive an award to collaborate
with relevant state partners in this effort.
Previously funded projects will be eligible for
continued support to digitize pages from new
decades, as the program increases its
chronological span. For this competition,
successful applicants will be selecting
newspapers=ADpublished in their state in English
between 1880 and 1922=ADand digitizing
approximately 100,000 pages, according to the
technical guidelines

outlined by the Library of Congress.
NDNP builds on the foundation established by an
earlier NEH initiative: the United States
Newspaper Program (USNP)
<<a href="http://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html">http://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html</a>>.
Since 1982, the Endowment has supported a
cooperative, national effort to locate, catalog,
and preserve on microfilm American newspapers
published from the 18th century to the present.
NEH has funded newspaper projects in all the
fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands. When completed in
2009, USNP will have provided bibliographic
control to widely scattered newspapers and have
preserved on microfilm (to consistent national
standards) selected titles from this vulnerable
corpus. LC has provided technical assistance
for the USNP since its inception.
NEH expects to award two-year cooperative
agreements (of up to $400,000 each), depending on
the availability of funds. The Application

Dear colleagues,
  From Sunday 19 August until Saturday 15 September, while I am away
from usual haunts, my access to e-mail will be otherwise than it
usually is, so there may be delays in the posting of messages to
Humanist, even the possibility that some messages may be lost. Please
be especially watchful for anything you may send, and resend if necessary.
One of the activities that keeps me away is worth much notice and
will be of professional interest to some -- the Contextualizing
Classics programme (www.proclassics.org) of the Faculty of Classical
and Modern Philology, University of Sofia "St Kliment Ohridski",
Sofia, Bulgaria. The session for 2007 is the last of three. The
website describes the factual details. What it does not say is that
this has been a splendid success in every way and is more than worthy
of imitation elsewhere. The Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation)
is to be commended for its wisdom in funding this programme.

Humanities Fellowship
To: undisclosed-recipients
Announcement of Digital Humanities Fellowship
at the
Stanford Humanities Center
We would appreciate if you would share this information with
colleagues who may be interested:
The Stanford Humanities Center seeks to award one Digital Humanities
fellowship for the academic year 2008-2009 to a junior or senior
scholar. Fellows are in residence at the Center during the regular
academic year (September to June) and participate in the Center's
intellectual life, sharing ideas and work in progress with a diverse
community of scholars from across the spectrum of academic fields and ranks.
The Digital Humanities fellowship online application deadline is
October 15, 2007.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship reflects the Stanford Humanities
Center's commitment to supporting new directions in humanities
research. The fellowship is intended for humanities scholars whose
research methods are critically shaped by information
technology.  Projects should be oriented to producing new research
outcomes rather than focusing primarily on the creation of archives
or software. Appropriate projects will approach significant questions
in humanistic study with the aid of new research tools or
methodologies.  Especially appropriate are candidates whose research
is likely to contribute to intellectual exchange among a diverse
group of scholars within the disciplines of the humanities.
Applicants normally will have received their PhD in or before
September 2005 to be eligible for 2008-2009 fellowships.   Fellows
are awarded stipends of up to $60,000. In addition, a housing and
moving allowance of up to $15,000 is offered, dependent upon need.

guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.
To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a
number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations
aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions of
system demonstrations.
We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 302 (302)

Dear all
This is a reminder that The Royal Academy of Engineering is holding
its next philosophy of engineering seminar, on engineering and
metaphysics, on Monday September 3rd at 2 for 2.30pm.  The seminar
will explore a number of metaphysical issues concerning the nature of
engineering, and the application of philosophical metaphysics to
engineering practice.  This should be a very interesting meeting
covering highly novel topics, with plenty of time for discussion.
The details of speakers and their talks are available on the flyer here:
<<a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/events/pdf/Engineering_Metaphysics_flyer.pdf">http://www.raeng.org.uk/events/pdf/Engineering_Metaphysics_flyer.pdf</a>><a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/events/pdf/Engineering_Metaphysics_flyer.pdf">http://www.raeng.org.uk/events/pdf/Engineering_Metaphysics_flyer.pdf</a>
If you would like to attend, please let me know using the details

Subject: Program for Chicago Colloquium
Date: Thu, 23 Aug 2007 12:16:01 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 303 (303)

on Digital Humanities and Computer Science
The program for the Second Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities
and Computer Science has now been set, and you can see it at http://
dhcs.northwestern.edu/index.html.  The Colloquium will take place on
Sunday and Monday, October 21-22, 2007 at Northwestern University.
This is an event jointly sponsored by the Illinois Institute for
Technology, Northwestern University, and the University of Chicago.
Registration is free, and you are cordially invited to attend.
Information about logistics will appear shortly on the web site. You
may also contact the conference coordinator, Nathan Mead (n-
mead2_at_northwestern.edu).
There still is room for poster sessions, and we will be delighted to
receive and review submissions on a rolling basis. Please send them
to dhcs-submissions_at_listhost.uchicago.edu.
The theme of this year's colloquium is "Exploring the scholarly query
potential of high quality text and image archives in a collaborative
environment." The presentations range widely across cultures and
technologies. There are digital surrogates of Mesopotamian cylinder
seals and of 3,000 clay statuettes from a Chinese Buddhist temple
that make you see things you could not easily see "in the flesh." How
to find readable and manipulable representations of the symbols that
appear in Isaac Newton's alchemical writings. How to explore the
"countless links" that are at the heart of the Orlando Project about
Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the
Present. How to make the history of North Carolina speak in different
ways when the print records (a massive work of late nineteenth
century scholarship) are translated into a digital medium.
A special session on Monday will explore the different ways in which
quite similar technologies of text mining support different goals in
legal, literary, and business analysis, and it will ask what these
different approaches can learn from each other.
The keynote speakers, Matt Kirschenbaum (The Remaking of Reading) and
Lew Lancaster (Beyond 2-D Text/Plan: The Chinese Buddhist in 3-D)
nicely define the range of topics. Ray Siemens will sum it all up.
I hope you will find this attractive enough to come.

Dear colleagues,
It's with great sadness that I write with news of 
the passing of Terry Butler, from the University 
of Alberta. Through the years he has been a 
valuable and enthusiastic member of the 
humanities computing community at his home institution, in Canada, and beyond.
Terry has led and participated in several 
important research projects in humanities 
computing, including TAPoR (for which he was 
Executive Manager at the UofA), the Coleridge 
Notebooks Project, and the Orlando Project. He 
also had a strong interest in education and 
technologies &#x2013; he developed several software 
applications himself and, more recently, led the 
TechEdge Project that is studying the IT 
competencies of liberal arts graduates. Terry was 
instrumental in the design and development of the 
M.A. in Humanities Computing at the University of Alberta.
Terry was a tireless force in promoting a better 
understanding of the potential of computing in 
the humanities and social sciences. He founded 
the Technology for Learning Centre at the 
University of Alberta, and was an invaluable 
resource to many colleagues there. One of Terry's 
most striking qualities was his ability to be 
effective both as administrative staff and as a 
researcher &#x2013; he had a knack for putting in place 
the structures that facilitated collaborative 
scholarship and teaching with computers.
Speaking more personally, Terry was always a 
supportive and generous friend and colleague who 
played an essential mentoring role for me as a 
new faculty member when I was at the University 
of Alberta. I learned a great deal from his 
organizational competencies, I benefitted from 
his experience and knowledge in humanities 
computing, and I enjoyed his company and our 
discussions on a broad range of topics.
Thanks for everything you did Terry &#x2013; you will be 
greatly missed. My thoughts and sympathies are with your family.

UBIQUITY ALERT: WRITING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT YOU KNOW
      Clear, concise, persuasive writing is a fundamental skill 
needed by every educated person whatever his or her profession. 
Unfortunately, very few people ever truly master it. Not because it 
is so difficult, but because schools seldom teach its true essence. 
IT people, perhaps more than most, know the importance of 
understanding the fundamentals of a discipline (e.g. mathematics) 
before it can effectively be put to use. Although a professional 
writer, Philip Yaffe has degrees in mathematics and physics from the 
University of California. His articles on persuasive communication 
(writing & speaking) reflect this background by going straight to the 
essence of the matter. His article in this issue of Ubiquity, How to 
Improve Your Writing by Standing on Your Head, should be read 
together with his previous article The Mathematics of Persuasive Communication
(<<a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/pf/v8i28_persuasive.pdf">http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/pf/v8i28_persuasive.pdf</a>).><a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/pf/v8i28_persuasive.pdf">http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/pf/v8i28_persuasive.pdf</a>).

SHARING AUTHORITY: Building Community-University Alliances through
Oral History, Digital Storytelling and Collaboration
A Bilingual (English/French) International Conference Workshop
Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada
Conference 7-10 February 2008
Deadline for Proposals: October 5, 2007
Please send a one-page abstract of your proposal and curriculum vitae
to the chair of the organizing committee: Steven High, Canada Research
Chair in Public History (shigh_at_alcor.concordia.ca)
Historian Michael Frisch coined the phrase "shared authority" in 1990
to describe the dialogical nature of the oral interview. The
interaction between the researcher asking questions and the community
narrator providing answers results in a unique source. At its best,
sharing authority is about much more than speaking to new audiences;
it requires the cultivation of trust, the development of collaborative
relationships, and shared decision-making. It cannot be rushed.
Yet sharing authority has become something of a mantra in oral and
public history circles in recent years. It is sometimes said that the
promise of extending this idea outward from the interview toward a
more broadly based democratic practice has generated enthusiasm but
few concrete results. The proposed conference, and a special issue of
the Journal of Canadian Studies that will come out of the conference,
will test this assertion.
It is our belief that the desire to democratize historical "writing"
(broadly defined) has animated a growing number of people, both inside
and outside university-settings. The 1970s, for example, saw the birth
of the "history workshop" in Great Britain, the "=E9comus=E9e" movement in
France, and community oral history projects in the United States.  The
"new museumology", "movement history" and "progressive public history"
also emerged at this time. But what has happened since?
Despite the growth of funding for collaborative research, there has
been remarkably little discussion of the public's place in the
research process: how, when, and should, authority be shared between
university-based researchers and "community" members. What role does
the "public" (in all its variations) play in our research? How
successful have collaborative research projects been thus far?   In
what ways have new digital technologies (blogs, digital memory banks,
and "Web 2.0" user communities such as YouTube or Flickr) been used to
bridge divides? How might we "share authority" in the history
classroom? Can the local, national and transnational communities we
study become true partners in research?
Proposals are invited from a broad range of university researchers,=
  community
organizations, educators, oral historians, public historians, and
others that are building research alliances that bridge the
university-community divide. We want to initiate a conversation about
sharing authority.  What can past practice teach us? What are the
possibilities and pitfalls in "sharing authority"? Can history become
a catalyst for social change and community building? How has the
digital revolution helped to democratize and expand the collaborative
process? A wide variety of proposals for individual papers, round
table discussions, and other kinds of presentations are welcome.

Concordia University and the Life Stories CURA Research Group (Life
Stories of Montrealers Displaced by War, Genocide and Other Human
Rights Abuses) which includes 40 researchers and community

Call for Papers for the 43rd International Congress on Medieval
Studies, May 8-11, 2008, Kalamazoo, Michigan
The Medieval Academy of America Committee on Electronic Resources
invites submissions to the following sponsored session:
"Digital Media and Peer Review in Medieval Studies"
Medievalists are increasingly turning to digital media both to
produce new types of scholarship such as encoded texts and
non-bookish digital projects ( e.g . archives and interactive
electronic resources) and to advance and increase the efficiency of
traditional forms of scholarship such as critical editions.  There is
not yet widespread agreement, however, regarding how this new work
should count for academic promotion, and many scholars working in
these new media find that there are few established avenues for
getting their work peer reviewed.  At the same time, we are
witnessing rapid and widespread changes in how we use print texts (
e.g. often in scanned, searchable copies), and many traditional
publishers of print journals and monographs are under enormous
financial pressures from declining sales and print runs, thereby
further limiting access to peer review and opportunities for
publication.  How can we, as a community, bring scholarship,
publishing, and the need for peer review into balance?
Please email abstracts (not to exceed 300 words) to Timothy Stinson
(<mailto:stinson_at_jhu.edu>stinson_at_jhu.edu). Please include name,
professional/university affiliation, and contact information.

Dear Colleagues,
If any of you are thinking of teaching students to analyze texts this
year using TAPoR tools we would be interested in working with you.
Some of things we would like to see tried are:
1. We have recipes for tasks that students might want to do as part
of their research. The recipes include examples and walk new users
through the tools needed to achieve a task. See,
<a href="http://tada.mcmaster.ca/Main/TaporRecipes">http://tada.mcmaster.ca/Main/TaporRecipes</a>
2. Instructors with a TAPoR account can create a myLinks web page
that has a list of e-texts which students can search across and which
students can individually analyze. See and example with texts about
humanities computing,
<a href="http://tapor2.mcmaster.ca/myLinks/HumComp">http://tapor2.mcmaster.ca/myLinks/HumComp</a>
3. Students can use tools without TAPoR accounts. They can search for
a tool and use it from,
<a href="http://portal.tapor.ca/tools/">http://portal.tapor.ca/tools/</a>
4. Students can, of course, get free accounts on TAPoR where they can
manage their own research environment.
If you are serious about trying TAPoR in a class we would like to
help you. Contact either of us:

lexicons, knowledge bases and ontologies, grammars, etc.
support the development of language processing applications
that are increasingly important to the global society.
Substantial effort has been devoted to the creation of such
resources for the world's major languages over the past
decades, and new projects are developing similar resources
for less widely-used languages. Some standards and best
practices have emerged for representing and linking
language corpora and annotations, efforts such as "Global
WordNet" and the development of framenets in multiple
languages seek to create and link specific lexical and
semantic resources across languages, and there are efforts
to integrate such resources into general ontologies such as
SUMO and to enable common access to ontologies spread across
the World Wide Web. As the need for cross-lingual studies and
applications grows, it is increasingly important to develop
resources in the world's languages that can be compared and
linked, used and analyzed with common software, and that
contain linguistic information for the same or comparable
phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a
"global web" of language resources, wherein, for example,
linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are
inter-linked via the use of common categories, or
categories that are mapped to one another; resources such
as wordnets and framenets are linked not only to versions
in different languages, but also to each other; and common
representations enable analysis and use of resources in
different languages and of different types within available
systems.
The first international conference on Global
Interoperability for Language Resources will bring together
designers, developers, and users of corpora and other
language resources from across the globe, in order to:
o  assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for
     resource representation, annotation, interlinkage, and
     access;
o  consider the requirements for (and obstacles to)
     multi-lingual and multi-modal interoperability and
     standardization;
o  consider the requirements for achieving interoperability
     among multi-lingual resources of different types,
     including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bases,
     ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and frameworks
     that enable their creation and exploitation;
o  consider the ways in which web technologies are and may
     be used to enable resource interoperability and inter-
     linkage;
o  work toward the definition of best practice guidelines
     and standards for language resource representation,
     annotation, and use that will enable interoperability;
o  consider means to map or harmonize linguistic
     information in order to better enable cross-lingual
     studies;
o  provide direction for developers of resources for less
     widely used languages;
o  promote collaboration and cooperation among developers
     of language resources across the globe;
o  consider ways to provide central or distributed access
     to language resources developed throughout the world.
TOPICS
Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the
following topics:
o  multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources,
     with focus on the mechanisms enabling interoperability;
o  support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in
     systems/frameworks for resource creation, annotation,
     use, and access;
o  existing and proposed standards and best practice guidelines
     for language resources, including standards for linguistic
     annotations at any and all linguistics levels;
o  systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the
     development and exploitation of interoperable language
     resources;
o  evaluation of existing resources, systems and
     frameworks, and/or standards in terms of support for
     interoperability;
o  harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language
     resources, including corpora, wordnets, framenets,
     ontologies, etc.;
o  web-based technologies for resource interoperability,
     inter-linkage, and access;
o  interoperability of ontologies for language processing
     research;
o  support for multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and
     multi-modality.
In addition to full-length paper presentations, the Program Committee
also invites proposals for posters addressing any of the above topics.
Posters describing existing or developing resources or tools that
provide an assessment of needs and/or considerations for interoperability
are especially encouraged.

Exploration through textual analyses
Seminar in Humanities Computing, King's College London
The first seminar in this year's Humanities Computing series will take
place at 1pm on Thursday 30th August 2007 in the Seminar room, 1st
floor, Kay House, 7 Arundel St;
*** English Medieval Latin Charters: Attribution and Exploration through
textual analyses ***
Dr Michael Gervers, University of Toronto
It is estimated that about a million charters survive as originals or
copies from twelfth- and thirteenth-century England, the great majority
of which were issued without dates.
The DEEDS Project, founded at the University of Toronto in 1975, has
developed an XML encoded database of over 9,500 charters from c. 1100
to 1310, dated either internally, or by an editor, to within a year of
the actual date of issue. These conveyances have been extracted from
over 190 printed sources, which in total contain over 100,000
documents. Charter metadata includes chronological and topographical
information, details of the religious house or lay household from which
the document came, and the roles, titles and social status of grantors
and recipients.
All are welcome!
Each year the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College
London, presents a series of lectures and demonstrations by leading
scholars, postgraduate students and practitioners from across the
disciplines of the humanities and nearby social sciences. The series
aims not only to present work at the leading edge of application but
also to provide a forum in which this work is subject to critical
reflection and thoughtful probing.

UBIQUITY ALERT: PROCESS EXPRESSION
       Ubiquity associate editor Ross Gagliano begins this book review:
"Karl Fant has written a very compelling book
that should be read by both academicians and
practitioners alike.  Here I speak from
experience, having assumed a role in both in
prior incarnations.  Fant's rejection of commonly
held mathematical foundations should pique the
curiosity of those in the theoretical computer
science community.  On the other hand, those in
the "real world" of circuits, architecture,
compilers, programming, operating systems, and
applications need to be aware of Fant's proposed clockless systems design."
Suggestion: First read the review by Ross
Gagliano, and then read Karl Fantd's new book,
"Computer Science Reconsidered: The Invocation Model of Process Expression."

Seminar: Text Encoding for Humanities Scholarship
We are pleased to announce a one and a half day seminar in digital
text encoding for humanities scholars to be held at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, in
conjunction with the Nebraska Digital Workshop. The Text Encoding for
Humanities Scholarship seminar will be held Oct. 4-5, beginning at 1
p.m. on the 4th.  The event will followed by the Nebraska Digital
Workshop on Oct. 6. Participants in the Text Encoding seminar will
examine the theoretical and practical ramifications of text encoding
for humanities scholarship, and the impact of the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) Guidelines on current approaches to digital
research. The goal of the seminar is to provide humanities faculty
and students with an opportunity to examine the significance of text
encoding as a scholarly practice, through a combination of discussion
and practical experimentation, and to provide supporting resources
for humanities researchers who want to experiment with text encoding
on their own, or would like to start or become involved with a
digital research project.
To register for the Text Encoding event, please send your name,
institution, email address, and a 2-paragraph statement of interest
and background to Katherine Walter at kwalter1_at_unl.edu. The seminar
cost is $35 US and can be paid on site.  Participation is limited, so
please submit information soon.
This seminar is the third in a two-year series funded by the National
Endowment for the Humanities and sponsored by the Women Writers
Project at Brown University. For more information on the seminar

CHArt TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL CONFERENCE -- BOOKING NOW OPEN!
<a href="http://www.chart.ac.uk/">http://www.chart.ac.uk/</a>
DIGITAL ARCHIVE FEVER
Thursday 8 - Friday 9 November 2007, Birkbeck, University of London.
PROGRAMME
Museums, galleries, archives, libraries and media
organisations such as publishers and film and
broadcast companies, have traditionally mediated
and controlled access to cultural resources and
knowledge. What is the future of such "top-down"
institutions in the age of "bottom-up" access to
knowledge and cultural artifacts through Web 2:0
technologies. Will such institutions respond to
this threat to their cultural hegemony by
resistance or adaptation? How can a museum or a
gallery or, for that matter, a broadcasting
company, appeal to an audience which has
unprecedented access to cultural resources? How
can institutions predicated on a cultural economy
of scarcity compete in an emerging state of
cultural abundance? The twenty-third CHArt
conference will reflect upon these issues.

For human exploration of the Moon and Mars
nations and agencies might soon be prepared with
regards technology development. But what of the
contribution from the humanities and social
sciences? This conference, co-organised by the
European Science Foundation (ESF), the European
Space Agency (ESA) and the European Space Policy
Institute (ESPI), will aim at being the first
comprehensive trans-disciplinary dialogue in
Europe on humans in outer space. It will go
further than regarding humans as mere tools for
exploration, or better robots, and will
investigate the human quest for odysseys beyond
the atmosphere and reflect on the possibilities
to find extraterrestrial life. The conference
shall open up new perspectives in assessing
humankind's present and future outside the Earth
and document this in a "Vienna Vision on Humans in Outer Space".
You are invited to attend this event, by
registering your participation through the above
link. The registration fee for this event is 130 euros.
Should the link not direct you to the page
immediately, please copy the link and paste it

Dear All,
ICT Guides is a service offered by the Arts and 
Humanities Data Service (AHDS) at King's College, 
London. It seeks to promote the use of ICTs in 
research and learning through cataloging 
good-practice digital arts and humanities 
projects along with the tools and methods they employed.
A number of new projects have been added to ICT 
Guides:

Highlight:
3D Reconstruction of the Unbuilt Project Pont 
destin  runir la France  l&#x2019;Italie (1829) by Henri Labrouste
" Henri Labrouste (1801-75) is best known as the 
architect of two important public buildings in 
Paris, both libraries. The Bibliothque 
Sainte-Genevive, completed in 1851, demonstrated 
Labrouste's unconventional use of classical 
elements, much disputed at the time, and his 
structural innovation of introducing an exposed 
iron frame. The Bibliothque Nationale, completed 
in the year of his death, is renowned for its 
eclectic reading room reminiscent of a Seljuk 
mosque: a light, top-lit round space with slender 
cast-iron columns, which support a multitude of 
small domes. Both these buildings are 
representative of the so-called Beaux-Arts style 
that flourished at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 
Paris of which Labrouste was a student. ". " See:

STRATEGIES FOR ONLINE TRAINING OF ONLINE FACULTY
In "Online Training for Online Faculty" (CAMPUS TECHNOLOGY, August 8,
2007) Ron Thomas, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, offers a
checklist of ten "best strategies for designing and delivering online
courses to train online faculty." Some of the suggestions include:
"Be their instructor, not their colleague."
"Train faculty on the same platform their students will use."
"Provide multiple safety nets for faculty during and after their
      training."
"Respect the faculty members' previous teaching experience."

REDUCING ATTRITION IN ONLINE CLASSES
"Attrition rates for classes taught through distance education are 10-
20% higher than classes taught in a face-to-face setting. . . . Finding
ways to decrease attrition in distance education classes and programs
is critical both from an economical and quality viewpoint. High
attrition rates have a negative economic impact on universities."
In "Strategies to Engage Online Students and Reduce Attrition Rates"
(THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATORS ONLINE, vol. 4, no. 2, July 2007), the
authors provide a review of the literature to determine methods for
"engaging students with the goals of enhancing the learning process and
reducing attrition rates." Their research identified four major
strategies:
-- student integration and engagement
Includes "faculty-initiated contact via phone calls, pre-course
      orientations, informal online chats, and online student
      services."
-- learner-centered approach
Faculty "need to get to know their students and assess each student's
      pre-existing knowledge, cultural perspectives, and comfort
      level with technology."
-- learning communities
"[S]trong feelings of community may not only increase persistence in
      courses, but may also increase the flow of information among
      all learners, availability of support, commitment to group
      goals, cooperation among members and satisfaction with group
      efforts."
-- accessibility to online student services.
Services might include "assessments, educational counseling,
      administrative process such as registration, technical support,
      study skills assistance, career counseling, library services,
      students' rights and responsibilities, and governance."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS' IT EXPERIENCES
A new EDUCAUSE Center for Applied Research (ECAR) research bulletin,
"Impressions of Community College Students' IT Experiences,"
"highlights some of the similarities and differences between students
attending four-year institutions and those attending community
colleges, focusing on those areas where there are challenges and
opportunities for using IT to improve students' academic experiences."
Since 2004, ECAR has studied undergraduate students and the impact of
information technology on their academic experiences. Now in its third
year, the study surveyed 96 institutions, including eight community
colleges. Compared to students at four-year institutions, community
college students reported:
-- "less use per week for most course-related activities, similar use
      for some social activities, and less use of social networking
      and instant messaging "
-- "fewer basic and fewer advanced skills with presentation software,
      spreadsheets, library resources, and CMSs"
-- "higher levels of ownership of PDAs, smart phones, gaming devices,
      digital cameras, and wireless hubs"
-- a high desire for computer labs, student IT training, and free
      access to software required for their courses
The research bulletin is available online at
<a href="http://connect.educause.edu/library/abstract/ImpressionsofCommuni/44739">http://connect.educause.edu/library/abstract/ImpressionsofCommuni/44739</a>
for all faculty, staff, and students from institutions that have
subscribed to ECAR.
ECAR "provides timely research and analysis to help higher education
leaders make better decisions about information technology. ECAR
assembles leading scholars, practitioners, researchers, and analysts to
focus on issues of critical importance to higher education, many of
which carry increasingly complicated and consequential implications."

"At first glance mathematics and persuasive communication -- writing,
and particularly public speaking -- would seem to have little in
common. After all, mathematics is an objective science, whilst speaking
involves voice quality, inflection, eye contact, personality, body
language, and other subjective components. However, under the surface
they are very similar."

"Clear, concise, persuasive writing is a fundamental skill needed by
every educated person whatever his or her profession. Unfortunately,
very few people ever truly master it. Not because it is so difficult,
but because schools seldom teach its true essence."

and humanities at the physics/biology interface
PRESS RELEASE
05 September 2007
Leeds, UK
Journal explores science and humanities at the physics/biology interface
Working at the Interface: Physics meets Biology is the June 2007 special
issue (volume 32, issue 3) of the journal Interdisciplinary Science
Reviews, and features a selection of high level papers from the
inaugural Entre-Sciences colloquium hosted by the French Fondation de la
Maison des Sciences de l'Homme at the National Museum of Natural History
and the Ecole Normale Suprieure (ENS) in Paris. Drawing together an
audience of scholars from the human sciences and 'practitioners' working
at the interface of physics and biology, the meeting prompted extensive
and lively discussion.
The special issue features papers from historians and philosophers of
science, physicists, biologists and anthropologists, which highlight the
tumultuous relations between the physical and biological sciences.
Papers include:
--      'Physics, biology and history', Michel 
Morange (Ecole Normale Suprieure,
Paris, France)
--      'Contenders for life at the dawn of the twenty-first century:
approaches from physics, biology and engineering', Evelyn Fox Keller
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA)
--      'Interdisciplinarity: some models from the human sciences',
Marilyn Strathern (University of Cambridge, UK)
--      'Synchrotron radiation sources: a focal point for multidisciplinary
research', Andrew W. Thompson (Synchrotron SOLEIL, France)
--      'The manipulation of single biomolecules', Jean-Franois Allemand1,
Gilles Charvin2, Vincent Croquette1, Giuseppe Lia2 and David Bensimon1
(1Ecole Normale Suprieure, Paris, France
2 Rockefeller University, USA, 3Harvard University, USA)
--      'Self-organisation processes in living matter', Eric Karsenti
(EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany)
--      'Modelling collective phenomena in neuroscience', Jean-Pierre
Nadal (Ecole Normale Suprieure, Paris, France)
In the past, physics was in the position of giving the life sciences the
theoretical apparatus they lacked. At present, in contrast, physicists
seem unable to answer the foundational question, 'What is life?', and
some may think physics now of use to the life sciences merely as a
purveyor of instrumentation. In practice, however, the situation is much
more complex.
While the historians concur in the view that physics cannot supply the
theoretical tools that could explain the fundamental questions, for
example how life appeared on Earth, the practitioners have a more
positive vision of the relationships between their disciplines:
statistical physics and the physics of dynamical systems can permit the
modelling of at least some biological issues.

individual papers, please see below or view the PDF on the ISR homepage

About the Association Entre-Sciences
The prestigious Association Entre-Sciences, based in Paris, has the
remit of promoting discussion on interdisciplinarity. By organising
forums for researchers drawn from different disciplines within the
natural sciences but working on common problems, and by enabling
discussions with specialists from the human sciences, the Entre-Sciences
approach is to bring together differing viewpoints, and to encourage
scientists to reflect on their practice in the light of this
interaction. For more information please visit
www.entre-sciences.msh-paris.fr

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 337 (337)

The NINES group spearheaded by Jerome McGann at UVA is trying to help
people get started with state-of-the-art digital projects. NINES held a
workshop in Summer 2005 which was extraordinarily successful in helping
people develop their digital editions. We'll hold another one 2008 at
Miami of Ohio for anyone who is interested. This summer workshop will
include instruction from Julia Flanders and Syd Bauman of the Brown
Women Writer's Project about how to code digital archives, as well as
seminars on database design, visualizing information, and mapping. We
expect two people to come from any given project -- more or less is
fine. Details appear on the CFP, attached, and here:

- CFP - Cultural Aspects of Interaction Design
CALL FOR PAPERS
A Special Issue on "Cultural Aspects of Interaction Design"
The notion of interaction design has become an indispensable aspect of
product design and development, especially for those products with embedded
information technologies. While traditional industrial design focuses on a
product's functionality and its physical features, interaction design
focuses on the interactive experience of users. Since products are becoming
more pervasively and more tightly interwoven with our daily activities,
design calls for a deeper understanding of the diverse perspectives of
product use.
Culture has been considered to play a critical role for users in their
understanding, acceptance, positioning, and use of an artifact. The quality
of an interactive experience is produced in a particular cultural context
and is determined or evaluated in that context. Yet, when it comes to
incorporating cultural factors effectively in design practice, knowledge is
insufficient at all levels -- conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and
practical. Cultural factors need to be integrated in the design process in
order to achieve the high quality of product interaction that enables our
experience with a product to be effective and enjoyable.
For this special issue of the International Journal of Design, we are
seeking papers that present breakthroughs in conceptual, theoretical,
methodological and practical research that enhance the formalization of
design knowledge with regard to the "cultural aspects of interaction
design." In particular, these contributions should focus on representing
cultural factors in describable, operable, and usable forms of design
knowledge with relevance to interaction design. The following topics are of
particular interest, covering fundamental and contemporary issues in this
domain:
- Conceptual framework of cultural factors in interaction design
- Acquisition and representation methods for cultural factors in design
- Formal models of cultural factors in interaction design
- Planning, design, and evaluation methods that involve cultural
perspectives
- Cultural aspects of interaction methods and languages
- Assessment of the cultural effects of new interactive products
- Cultural factors in Kansei/emotional/affective aspects of interaction
- Cultural contexts of interaction design for ambient intelligence
environments
- Cultural factors related to usability

Full Paper Due: 28 February 2008

eHumanities -- Track Chairs: Marc Wilhelm Kuester and Matthew Allen
Digital Ecosystem is defined as an open, loosely coupled, domain
clustered, demand-driven, self-organising collaborative environment,
where each species is proactive and responsive for its own benefit or
profit.
Digital eco-systems occur through the interactions between both human
and computer-based agents, operating in a manner that creates both
relationships of cooperation and conflict within the system as well as
the overall system itself. Analysis of the role of human perception,
engagement and expectation is critical, therefore, to understanding the
complexity of digital ecosystems as well as the operational dynamics of
any specific system. Furthermore, our capacity to build, maintain and
further develop viable digital ecosystems rests on clear, theoretical
and applied, understanding of the way in which humans and computers
interact with one another in digital, networked environments.
Put simply, the e-Humanities researchers will pursue a research agenda
that will explore the social, cultural, political and economic
determinants that constitute the foundational terrain within which
ecosystems exist. In doing so, they will also analyse the manner in
which, through human action within a digital ecosystem, human beliefs,
understandings and desires come to influence that system. Through
consideration of the results of human endeavours within digital
eco-systems, these researchers will also come to understand the ways in
which networked digital communications can enhance or, indeed, imperil
social and cultural development.
There are several research directions of the work in e-Humanities. The
first concerns the manner in which 'intelligent' interactive expertise
networks might be developed to solve the problems of knowledge-based
distributed collaboration between experts and those who draw on their
expertise. A 'networks of interactive knowledge=E2'(NIKs) approach can be
usefully applied to education (both formal and informal), sustaining
professional competence, e-research, e-participation, e-government and
other forms of scholarly collaboration, as well as other situations in
which people need to collaborate through exchanges of partial knowledge
so that they might construct a collective expertise greater than the sum
of its individual parts. This is related to a second component, working
in standards-based, interoperable distributed service and resource
environments, e. g. service and resource networks or grids that allow
seamless integration on both tool and the resource side. The third
component of research concerns the broader relationship of technology
and society, with particular reference to the cultures and politics of
society's adoption of, and adaption to, new forms of technologically
mediated communication and information sharing and of technology's
requirements to adapt to existing cultural semiotic processes.
This research is largely being pursued through individual research
projects involving the development of theoretical knowledge to guide
further practical development, or deeper understandings of previous
technological developments, though in the future these projects can link
together to form a larger digital eco-system of systems. To foster such
cooperation is a major longterm goal of the track.

Seminar: What Good is e-Learning?
When: Friday 5 October, 2007, 6.30-9.00pm
Where: London Knowledge Lab, 23-29 Emerald Street, London WC1N 3QS
Will the new media technologies increasingly to be deployed in
schools really change how children learn? In promising a more
personalised approach to learning, they offer a vision of each child
reaching their full potential, through being actively involved in
choosing their own learning paths and styles. While the national
curriculum may remain in place as an overall set of objectives,
schools will cease to offer a 'one size fits all' system of
education. Teachers will do less teaching in the traditional sense,
but will become guides helping children along their chosen learning
paths, facilitated and mediated through 'virtual learning
environments' . Not everyone accepts the idea that children are best
taught in this way and some fear that this new direction may fragment
education and undermine its capacity to give children a broad view of
the world and a clear sense of their future within it. What is the
best way of thinking about the innovatory potential of new
technologies in education? How can we make the most of what they can
offer while keeping the best of what a teacher-led, subject-based
curriculum has provided in the past?
Confirmed speakers:
Professor David Buckingham, London Knowledge Lab;
Chris Poole, Microsoft, BSF;
Toby Marshall, FE teacher and writer on learning technologies;

Subject: change threatens
Date: Tue, 18 Sep 2007 07:11:23 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 352 (352)

Many here will know the book by Sven Birkerts, The Gutenberg Elegies:
The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age (1994), and perhaps also
Jerome McGann's response in "A Note on the Current State of
Humanities Scholarship", Critical Inquiry 30.2 (2004): 409-13.
Against the evident fact that digital textualities are in explosive
growth, and the narrowing bottleneck in scholarly publication, McGann
asks, "how prepared are we to emulate the humanists of the fifteenth
century who were confronted with a similar upheaval of their
materials, means, and modes of knowledge production?" By "prepared"
McGann means not just emotionally ready-to-go but imaginatively,
intellectually fit for the task. Most of our colleagues, I'd guess,
would express the former preparedness, but evidence for the latter is
thin on the ground -- hence the seriousness with which he takes
Birkert's "very bad advice" to a great refusal.
Birkerts is not the only dangerous false prophet of doom. Now there's
Andrew Keen, whose Cult of the Amateur: How today's internet is
killing our culture (2007) is well reviewed by Paul Duguid (Berkeley
& PARC), whose essay "Material Matters: Aspects of the past and
futurology of the book", in the excellent collection edited by John
Seely Brown, The Future of the Book, and online at
www2.parc.com/ops/members/brown/papers/mm.html, should be required
reading. His review, "Is the Web a threat to culture", has just been
published in the Times Literary Supplement for 12 September and is
fortunately online as well, from <a href="http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/">http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/</a> (grab
it while you can). Apart from pointing out that Keen's argument is
flawed in several ways, Duguid puts his finger on what seems to me
the central question: what "culture" is threatened by the likes of
Wikipedia? He refers to Raymond Williams' wonderful, brilliant and
magnanimous essay, "Culture is ordinary", contrasting it with the
frightened impulse to shut down anything that threatens old days
falsely remembered as entirely good, prior to a Decline and Fall
which must be pinned on something. "Keen is clearly outraged," Duguid
writes, "and his book yearns for the... power to stamp it all out.
Failing that, his last chapter proposes a range of government
interventions, few of which are new and fewer likely to be
effective." Keen's proposed measures may be doomed, but the problem
is not legislation that (we must hope) will never be. The problem is
that frightened, antintellectual impulse, which blocks understanding,
slowing down the vital work to be done. The resurfacing argument,
however weak as well as false, is a problem for us. It is an argument
that must be faced in the public sphere, by a species we've not yet
had the time to grow, the public intellectual.
Change *is* threatening. I suppose the question is *what* it threatens,
and how we respond.
Comments?
Yours,

CALL FOR PAPERS
A Special Issue on "Cultural Aspects of Interaction Design"
The notion of interaction design has become an indispensable aspect
of product design and development, especially for those products with
embedded information technologies. While traditional industrial
design focuses on a product's functionality and its physical
features, interaction design focuses on the interactive experience of
users. Since products are becoming more pervasively and more tightly
interwoven with our daily activities, design calls for a deeper
understanding of the diverse perspectives of product use.
Culture has been considered to play a critical role for users in
their understanding, acceptance, positioning, and use of an artifact.
The quality of an interactive experience is produced in a particular
cultural context and is determined or evaluated in that context. Yet,
when it comes to incorporating cultural factors effectively in design
practice, knowledge is insufficient at all levels -- conceptual,
theoretical, methodological, and practical. Cultural factors need to
be integrated in the design process in order to achieve the high
quality of product interaction that enables our experience with a
product to be effective and enjoyable.
For this special issue of the International Journal of Design, we are
seeking papers that present breakthroughs in conceptual, theoretical,
methodological and practical research that enhance the formalization
of design knowledge with regard to the "cultural aspects of
interaction design." In particular, these contributions should focus
on representing cultural factors in describable, operable, and usable
forms of design knowledge with relevance to interaction design. The
following topics are of particular interest, covering fundamental and
contemporary issues in this domain:
- Conceptual framework of cultural factors in interaction design
- Acquisition and representation methods for cultural factors in design
- Formal models of cultural factors in interaction design
- Planning, design, and evaluation methods that involve cultural perspectives
- Cultural aspects of interaction methods and languages
- Assessment of the cultural effects of new interactive products
- Cultural factors in Kansei/emotional/affective aspects of interaction
- Cultural contexts of interaction design for ambient intelligence environments
- Cultural factors related to usability

hello -
I am a newby just joining this list.  At the invitation of the list owner,
I'm throwing something out for your consideration.
I just blogged a fascinating paper by the sociologist Andrew Abbott
of the univ of chicago called The Traditional Future, which discusses
the nature of library-based research, and the ramifications for its
conduct and results of the growing dominance of large repositories
of digitized texts.  I amplify those themes somewhat, as they are of
great concern to me.  any comments here, or on the blog, are much
appreciated.

TECHNOLOGY AS POLITICS
Charalambos Tsekeris writes: "More activist approaches to technology
are indeed more productive and useful than any pessimistic
(technophobic) diagnosis reducing it to a mere instrument of
domination and oppression. The "it could be otherwise" clause of
liberal intellectual inquiry must remain central to our current
critical theoretical efforts." (Tsekeris graduated from Brunel
University and earned his doctoral degree in Sociology from Athens
Panteion University. He is a member of the Greek scientific group
Intellectum and a researcher on the complex relationships between
technoscience, culture and politics.)

A curtain of tiny screens with live quotations from Internet chat;
stories generated by computer programs; narratives generated by their
readers; words that disappear or reveal themselves depending on their
readers position, texts that peels off the wall and require the
'reader' to push it back. How shall we read such moving letters? How
do we catch their meanings? How might they make us feel? The
conference brings together ten specialists from the USA and Germany
to search for answers through in-depth analyses.

The Third Asia-Pacific Computing and Philosophy Conference will again
take place at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. The
conference is being held in succession to the successful Second Asia-
Pacific Conference in January 2005
(<a href="http://www.stc.arts.chula.ac.th/CAP/AP-CAP.html">http://www.stc.arts.chula.ac.th/CAP/AP-CAP.html</a>).
AP-CAP2007 is part of the series of conferences organized by the
International Association for Computing and Philosophy
(<a href="http://www.ia-cap.org">http://www.ia-cap.org</a>). The conferences have been in held in various
regions of the world. As of now there are three major regions where
these conferences are held, namely in North America (NA-CAP), Europe
(ECAP) and Asia- Pacific.
As with the other CAP conferences, AP-CAP2007 will also deal with all
aspects of the "computational turn" that is occurring through the
interaction of the disciplines of philosophy and computing. And in
continuation from the second conference, papers dealing with
'cultural' aspects of computing and philosophy would be specially
emphasized, though papers in other areas will of course be welcome.
The conference is interdisciplinary: We invite papers from
philosophy, computer science, social science and related disciplines.

Humanities Observatory
Dear colleagues,
Subsequent to the Humanist posting about the position as Director of
the new Digital Humanities Observatory -- a creation of the Royal
Irish Academy (Dublin) and a *very* promising opportunity for the
right candidate -- I've been informed that full details of the
position are now available on the RIA website - www.ria.ie.
Recently I served as external assessor for the funding round
conducted by the Irish Higher Education Authority, so I can say with
authority (pun intended) that the Observatory has the potential to be
among the best of the good news for our field.
Yours,
WM

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 379 (379)

The following appeared recently in the Times Higher Education
Supplement and was forwarded to me by a colleague.
[deleted quotation]A colleague of mine who runs a large teaching programme remarked some
time ago that in order to protect his staff members from becoming
overwhelmed with e-mails from students, who were expecting answers
almost immediately whatever the day and hour, he had to write a
policy document defining what could be considered reasonable
expectations for replying to questions by that medium. On the other
hand, given the style and kind of work that I do, I have yet to
develop a problem with what Marshall calls "pinging" (which is a
technically inaccurate phrase, since one can choose when to
respond).  So I wonder: what *is* the problem? Someone with
hundreds of students would clearly have to do something, but still
I think more is involved here.
Marshall's statement that,
[deleted quotation]seems right to me, because what he is talking about in this sentence
is not some inherent or inevitable property of the medium but our
understanding of how to use it to effect what we want. This means in
part mastering our own reactions. As with the spectacular problem of
"infoglut" that was once all the rage to complain about, in the early
years of Humanist, for example, the problem is at least in part how
we react, which includes the mechanisms, formats and procedures we
set up to shape and direct the potential of something with
significant potential. Getting involved for hours managing discussion
forums is a choice one can make. When I was a graduate student at
Toronto teaching one class a term, I found myself spending nearly all
my time on it -- a convenient excuse not to face the challenges of my
doctoral research. I imagine that's a common experience. One can also
find administrative tasks irresistible because they provide that
perfect excuse (yes, there are nobler reasons!).
Marshall concludes by saying that,
[deleted quotation]This seems to me quite wrong -- and in a way that is typically wrong
in reactions to new inventions: first to determine what the subject
needs or wants to do, then to design some form of the invention to
fit the need or want. This seems to me the irritated reaction of
someone who does not want to change rather than a question from
someone who sees that we all need to negotiate our place in a changing world.

Dear colleagues,
As a followup to the question I just asked about interactions between
CS and the digital humanities, let me ask another. What are the
interesting problems & "grand challenges" arising in the digital
humanities that interest or should interest people in CS? Similarly,
excluding the funding concepts, what's in computer science research
that interests or should interest us in the humanities?
All comments welcome.
Many thanks.

Dear Mr McCarty,
just a very brief note, since it is a cheeky self-reference:
TextGrid - www.textgrid.de
... we are the German grid/humanities project and attempt to employ
grid technologies for scholars in the humanities. we are 4 technical
partners and 4 from literature and language.
first step: (a) a virtual archive / trusted repository, and (b) an
extensible tool network for text-based scientific work. based on grid
technology.
I'm sure you know Tobias Blanke at the Arts and Humanities e-Science
Support Centre (AHeSSC, KCL) - he'd be able to give you a host of
exciting references for the UK ...

Willard,
I did a presentation on this as "audition" for my current position
teaching in a computer science department.  My academic training was
as a musicologist (Medieval Liturgical Drama), but I spent most of my
career as a computer programmer (I had to make a living
somehow!).  My presentation, "A Bridge Too Far?: Computing and
Humanities Research" can be found at:
<<a href="http://nortonlx.cs.jmu.edu/papers/NortonJMU2001.ppt">http://nortonlx.cs.jmu.edu/papers/NortonJMU2001.ppt</a>><a href="http://nortonlx.cs.jmu.edu/papers/NortonJMU2001.ppt">http://nortonlx.cs.jmu.edu/papers/NortonJMU2001.ppt</a>
(use 134.126.20.61 if the URL doesn't work - there is a DNS problem on my end).
My own take on this was guided largely by my contact, for the first
time really, with "true" computer scientists, who viewed the world
quite differently than did I.  I was really quite struck by the gulfs
in understanding and outlook that I encountered, and this
presentation was my means for trying to come to terms with it.
A couple of later papers that extend some of the ideas expressed here are:
"Modeling the Visitatio Sepulchri: Some Problems of Representation"

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 383 (383)

I agree with Willard's final assessment--this sounds like the kind of
article that organs like the THES and other similar journals like to
write, without either studying the actual habits of academics overall
(and the wide range of actual responses to the effects and
opportunities of technology) or thinking carefully  about what's
really going on.
It seems to me, perhaps uncharitably, that the perceived need to
answer email as soon as it comes in is:
--a new expression of an old urge: procrastination and bad time
management has always been endemic in a profession where the things
you're really supposed to be doing are difficult and sometimes
painful, with a long-deferred horizon of reward; this problem is not
produced by technology
--a little passive-aggressive: "your expectation that I answer in 30
minutes forces me to answer in 30 minutes..."
--not that difficult to solve in practical ways if one wants to
(change the setting on your email program so that it doesn't check
for new mail every two minutes)
What is fascinating about this article is the way it slips quietly
from the problem of technology (too much email, too urgent, not
enough time for research) to recast the problem as a competition
between research and teaching/assessment, with a weird implicit
alignment of teaching and technology:
[deleted quotation]This is fine on the face of it, observing that academics don't
necessarily possess the technical skills to develop their own online
course materials efficiently. But it seems to me that what's beneath
this line of thought is the idea (more explicitly expressed a little
further down) that teaching and assessment are really the problem in
a domain where research is really the goal, and that technology can
help if one doesn't try to take responsibility for it but instead
delegates that role to instructional technologists or developers of
online courseware:
[deleted quotation]The implication is that academics are fools to put the same kind of
imagination and individual effort into their teaching as they do into
their research, and that they are fools to try to engage directly
with the technologies that form their teaching practice. In other
words, it positions technology as instrumental for rather than
constitutive of both teaching and research, and as a result assesses
it purely for the success or failure of its instrumental effects.
This, I think, is also why its analysis of the email problem is off
the mark: it treats email as something external that is visited upon
us, rather than as a communicative habit that arises out of the same
urges and motivations we've had all along. The idea of "a few simple
fixes" is about as helpful, as an analysis of the impact of
technology on the academy, as the idea that we could all increase our
research output if we would just all sit down and write 100 words each day.
Best wishes, Julia

[deleted quotation]I had a friend whose office was nearby -- he was a Professor of
Biology who later became Dean of the School of Sciences.  His
approach to phone messages -- the Internet had not yet loomed over
the horizon -- was "if you just wait long enough to reply to them,
the matter isn't important any more."  Later, when the Internet came
along, he behaved in the same manner.

Ranjit Makkuni, of the Sacred World Foundation, India, will speak
about the making
of the Eternal Gandhi Multimedia Museum. He will present a language of physical
   interface actions derived from classical symbols of the spinning wheel,
   turning of the prayer wheels, touching symbolic pillars, the act of hands
   touching sacred objects, collaboratively constructed quilts, sacred chanting
in the collective group, the satsanga and the touching and rotating of prayer
   beads. These tradition-based interactions inspire a rich panorama of tactile
   interfaces that allow people to access the multimedia imagery and
multidimensional mind of Gandhiji.
Eternal Ghandi was a winner of ID Magazine Design Award in 2006.

Dear colleagues,
As a followup to the question I just asked about interactions between
CS and the digital humanities, let me ask another. What are the
interesting problems & "grand challenges" arising in the digital
humanities that interest or should interest people in CS? Similarly,
excluding the funding concepts, what's in computer science research
that interests or should interest us in the humanities?
All comments welcome.
Many thanks.

In reference to the recent conversation provoked by the opinions of
Ian Marshall on the tyranny of technology, especially e-mail, the
following will give you pause to reflect on a somewhat deeper matter.
In his delightful Portraits from Memory, Bertrand Russell has the
following to say about Alfred North Whitehead (with whom he wrote the
Principia Mathematica):

Special Issue on HYBRID LOGIC
IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission: March 1, 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 1, 2008
Publication: by the end of 2008
GENERAL INFORMATION
Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which 
it is possible to directly refer  to 
worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of 
the (Kripke) model are meant  to represent. 
Although they date back to the late 1960s, and 
have been  sporadically investigated ever since, 
it is only in the 1990s that work on them  really got into its stride.
It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on 
applied grounds, because of the  usefulness of 
the additional expressive power. For example, 
when reasoning about time one often wants to 
build up a series of assertions about what 
happens at a  particular instant, and standard 
modal formalisms do not allow this. What is 
less  obvious is that the route hybrid logic 
takes to overcome this problem often  actually 
improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism. For example,
it becomes far simpler to formulate modal 
tableau, resolution, and natural  deduction in 
hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation 
results can be  proved of a generality that is 
not available in orthodox modal logic.
This special issue has its origin in the 
International Workshop on Hybrid Logic  (HyLo 
2007), which was held 6-10 August in Dublin, 
Ireland as part of the  European Summer School in 
Logic, Language, and Information (ESSLLI 
2007).  The HyLo 2007 workshop continued a series 
of previous workshops on hybrid logic.
TOPICS
Topics of interest include not only standard 
hybrid-logical machinery like  nominals, 
satisfaction operators, and the downarrow binder, 
but generally  extensions of modal logic that increase its expressive power.
SUBMISSIONS
This special issue welcomes original high-quality 
contributions that have been  neither published 
in nor submitted to any journals or refereed 
conferences.  All submissions will be refereed to usual journal standards.

ONLINE INSTRUCTORS AND BURNOUT
"The growth of distance education in higher education establishes a
need to examine burnout specific to online instructors. Although
burnout among educators has been studied, no specific work has been
conducted relative to burnout among higher education online
instructors."
A 2005 study of 76 online instructors by R. Lance Hogan and Mark A.
McKnight explored burnout in this segment of educators. Their research
sought answers to three questions:
        "To what degree does burnout occur in higher education online
        instructors?"
        "Is there a significant relationship between gender and burnout
        level of higher education online instructors?"
        "How do measures of burnout among higher education online
        instructors compare with the existing normative data of
        educators?"
Their findings are reported in "Exploring Burnout among University
Online Instructors: An Initial Investigation" (THE INTERNET AND HIGHER
EDUCATION, vol. 10, no. 2, 2007). The paper is available on the Web at

STUDIES OF STUDENTS AND IT
Since 2004, the EDUCAUSE Center for Applied Research (ECAR) has
conducted longitudinal studies of students and information technology.
The latest report, "The ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and
Information Technology, 2007," presents data from a spring 2007 survey
and interviews with nearly 28,000 freshman, senior, and community
college students at 103 higher education institutions. Some of the
findings from this year's study include:
-- "Today's students spend a lot of time online. Respondents report
spending an average of 18 hours per week actively doing online
activities for work, school, or recreation, and 6.6 percent (more often
male) spend more than 40 hours per week."
-- Students surveyed "overwhelmingly (85.1 percent) favor e-mail for
official college and university communications. . . . A resounding 82.5
percent say they prefer a university account" rather than a commercial
account for these communications.
-- "While most respondents are enthusiastic IT users and use it to
support many aspects of their academic lives, most prefer only a
'moderate' amount of IT in their courses (59.3 percent)."
The research bulletin is available online at
<a href="http://www.educause.edu/ers0706">http://www.educause.edu/ers0706</a>.
ECAR "provides timely research and analysis to help higher education
leaders make better decisions about information technology. ECAR
assembles leading scholars, practitioners, researchers, and analysts to
focus on issues of critical importance to higher education, many of
which carry increasingly complicated and consequential implications."

"Faculty Integration of Technology into Instruction and Students'
        Perceptions of Computer Technology to Improve Student Learning"

"[R]eports indicate that faculty members are not integrating technology
into instruction in ways that make a difference in student learning. To
help faculty make informed decisions on student learning, there is need
for current knowledge of faculty integration practices. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to examine the nature of the relationship
between faculty integration of technology into classroom instruction
and students' perceptions of the effect of computer technology to
improve their learning."

"Damn Spam: The Losing War on Junk E-Mail"
by Michael Specter
THE NEW YORKER, August 6, 2007
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/06/070806fa_fact_specter">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/06/070806fa_fact_specter</a>
Specter charts the history of spam email from its beginnings in the
1970s to the present. Spam haters will find no predictions of relief
from the onslaught. The spammers are at least one step ahead of filters
and trappers designed to ward off their messages:
"Last year, spammers began to take advantage of the fact that computers
can't see, and buried their messages in images. Most filters look for
words and phrases or Internet address information. A picture contains
so much more data that it is hard for the computer to find the message
embedded in all the noise. Humans who click on the message have no
trouble seeing it, though. Image spam consumes far more bandwidth than
written messages, and that means it will devour even more space on
computer servers throughout the world, costing more money and wasting
more time. But spammers aren't stopping there. They are learning to
send out polymorphic spam, thousands of variations of the same message,
which makes each message unique and therefore hard to categorize."

Steven Levy, the chief technology writer for

best-selling books, the latest of which is "The
Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Culture,
Commerce, and Coolness." When we asked acclaimed
software developer Marney Morris to comment on
this interview and she responded: "I've been
reading Steven Levy's thoughts on technology for
over 20 years, and he is still as fresh and
insightful as he was back then -- in the
beginning days of the personal computer. Steven
weaves the implications of technology change into
social meaning with wit and intelligence. He was
the best, brightest and funniest guy in the tech
arena before he moved to Newsweek in '95, and he
still is. He is a great guy and a great
journalist. I'm honored that I got to say so."

MARK YOUR CALENDAR
    Balisage: The Markup Conference
    August 12 - 15, 2008
    (workshop: August 11, 2008)
Montral in August has always been the place and time for serious
markup geeks to meet, and this year there's an all-new conference
for them.
Balisage is designed to meet the needs of markup theoreticians and
practitioners who are pushing the boundaries of the field. It's all
about the markup: how to create it; what it means; hierarchies and
overlap; modeling; taxonomies; transformation; query, searching,
and retrieval; presentation and accessibility; making systems that
make markup dance (or dance faster to a different tune in a smaller
space) - in short, changing the world and the web through the power
of marked-up information.

DIGITAL ARCHIVE FEVER
Thursday 8 - Friday 9 November 2007, Birkbeck, University of London.
PROGRAMME
Museums, galleries, archives, libraries and media
organisations such as publishers and film and
broadcast companies, have traditionally mediated
and controlled access to cultural resources and
knowledge. What is the future of such =91top-down'
institutions in the age of =91bottom-up' access to
knowledge and cultural artifacts through Web 2:0
technologies. Will such institutions respond to
this threat to their cultural hegemony by
resistance or adaptation? How can a museum or a
gallery or, for that matter, a broadcasting
company, appeal to an audience which has
unprecedented access to cultural resources? How
can institutions predicated on a cultural economy
of scarcity compete in an emerging state of
cultural abundance? The twenty-third CHArt
conference will reflect upon these issues.

                     Call for Participation
                  3rd International Workshop on
        Vocabularies, Ontologies and Rules for The Enterprise
                           (VORTE 2007)
           <a href="http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/VORTE/">http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/VORTE/</a>
             Annapolis, Maryland, USA, October 15, 2007
The goal of the workshop is to discuss the role
that foundational and domain ontologies play in
the conceptual development and implementation of
next generation tools for enterprise computing.
The VORTE workshop covers research topics
relevant to description formalisms for enterprise
application architectures, services, content, and
regulations. Since enterprise vocabularies and
ontologies, as well as business rules do not
exist in isolation but serve to support business
processes, this year a special emphasis is on
business process modelling and management.
Fundamental research aspect covered by the
workshop includes ontological evaluation of
enterprise systems and their interoperability,
and ontological analysis of business process
modelling. Applied research aspect includes
enhancing business rule engines and business
process management systems by ontologies. In the
area of modelling, our topics include how process
modelling and execution languages, such as
Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) and
Business Process Execution Language (BPEL),
relate to business ontologies. The workshop also
covers ontology-based service description
technologies for inter-enterprise collaboration
like extensions to UDDI or OWL-S.
This definitely promises a lot of fun, and we are
looking forward to meeting you in Annapolis.

Subject: Days and Disappearances
Date: Tue, 09 Oct 2007 10:44:32 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 395 (395)

On or about the disappearing day...
Dear Willard,
Canadian Thanksgiving this year falls on October 8. Curious, I
checked Wikipedia for pointers on events in
history. Consulting the "October 8" entry I found the following:
<quote>
* 1582 - Due to the implementation of the Gregorian calendar this day
does not exist in this year in Italy,
Poland, Portugal and Spain.
</quote>
I found myself drifting towards reflecting upon the difference
between "day" as a part of a date and "day"
as an experiential unit independent of the the date. It perhaps a
mark of being a frequent reader of
Humanist that I thought an elucidation of the distinction would be a
perfect prize exam question ...
With thoughts of humanities computing in mind I continued with my
meditations on time by turning to some
lines from the poem "The Drunken Clock" by Gwendolyn MacEwen. [In my
universe everything connects.]
<quote>
Clocks count forward with craze, but<lb/>
bells count backwards in sober grace.
<cit>Volume One: The Early Years. ed. by Margaret Atwood and Barry
Callaghan.</cit>
</quote>
By analogy we can appreciate how the of evolution of computing power
has spawned clock-driven projects that
attempt to do more in less time and how distribution of such
computing power has placed bells ready to
chime in many more places. It is perhaps a truism that rhythm and
synchronization, hallmarks of multimedia
p,r,o,d,u,c,t,i,o,n, depend upon careful alignments and
segmentations. A day is to a bell as a date is to a
clock? Or vice versa?
Next, I turned from poetry to scholarship. I have been plunged of
late in Anthony Grafton's wonderful book
on Joseph Scaliger. I found myself thinking that Scaliger's "turn to
chronology" amounts to a moment in the
prehistory of humanities computing. Historical chronology is where
the disciplines of astronomy and
critical editing intersected and where evidence and model building
operated closely. And so Grafton gives
us a picture of
The craze...
<quote>
Scaliger's reconstruction also required him to ignore or distort
other texts directly relevant to his
enterprise.
</quote>
The grace...
<quote>
Still, whatever Scaliger's errors, he had assembled the data and
raised the problems on which legions of
learned chronologers would gnash their teeth and exercise their wits
for centuries to come.
</quote>
A Scaliger prize for future students, prize devoted to time in computing?
And so as the day disappears and the bell tolls, you find me thankful
for your kind moderation of such an
excellent seminar and leaving you to ponder further the clocks and
bells of our mind machines.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 397 (397)

Announcing the release of version 3.1 of Diogenes, a free program for
reading the databases of Latin and Greek texts published on CD-Rom by
the Packard Humanities Institute and the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae.
<a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.heslin/Software/Diogenes/">http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.heslin/Software/Diogenes/</a>
The major new feature in this version is that, thanks to the
generosity of the Perseus project, morphological data and dictionaries
for Latin (Lewis-Short) and Greek (LSJ) and are built-in.  This means
that you can:
* Click on a word in the texts and get a morphological analysis and
    the corresponding dictionary entry instantly, even if you are not
    connected to the Internet.
* Click to analyze words in the dictionary entries themselves, or
    click on the citation information of a passage cited in the
    dictionary to jump to the context of the passage in the Latin or
    Greek database.
* Do morphologically intelligent searching, i.e. search for all of the
    inflected forms of a given dictionary headword.
* Look up words in the dictionaries.
In addition, version 3 of Diogenes is newly based on the Firefox
browser and should be very easy to install, much more so than
previously.  Easy-to-install packages are provided for Mac OS X,
Windows, and Linux.  Installation just takes a couple of clicks.
Version 3.1 also includes a number of new features that had long been
requested:
* Unicode input (now the default).
* Saving user-defined subsets of the databases for repeated searching.
* Running marginal numeration when browsing through a text.
* Improved Unicode output.
* For network installations, individual user settings (via cookies).

UBIQUITY CITED BY TOM FRIEDMAN OF THE NEW YORK TIMES
In the new edtion of his best-selling book "The
World Is Flat," New York Times columnist Thomas
Friedman favorably cited the Ubiquity article by
Espen Anderson titled "Why You Should Choose Math
in High School."  From that article Friedman
called particular attention to the words: "Choose
math because you will meet it more and more in
the future. Math becomes more and more important
in all areas of work and scholarship. Future
journalists and politicians will talk less and
analyze more. Future police officers and military
personnel will use more and more complicated
technology. Future nurses and teachers will have
to relate to numbers and technology every day.
Future car mechanics and carpenters will use
chip-optimization and stress analysis as much as
monkey wrenches and hammers. There will be more
math at work, so you will need more math at school."

Ranjit Makkuni, of the Sacred World Foundation, India, will speak
about the making of the Eternal Gandhi Multimedia Museum. He will
present a language of physical interface actions derived from
classical symbols of the spinning wheel, turning of the prayer
wheels, touching symbolic pillars, the act of hands touching sacred
objects, collaboratively constructed quilts, sacred chanting in the
collective group, the satsanga and the touching and rotating of
prayer beads. These tradition-based interactions inspire a rich
panorama of tactile interfaces that allow people to access the
multimedia imagery and multidimensional mind of Gandhiji.

Those here interested in the application of
statistical techniques to study language will be
interested in work done by Erez Lieberman and
colleagues at Harvard and MIT, an account of
which has recently been published in Nature 449
for 11 October, "Quantifying the evolutionary
dynamics of language", pp. 713-16, and summarized

Lieberman and colleagues have studied the
evolution of verb forms from Old English to the
present using mathematical evolutionary models.
Comment on this work from someone who understands
the techniques involved would be welcome. Thanks
to Jean-Claude Gudon for drawing my attention to this work.

first in a special two-issue interdisciplinary investigation into the
concept and history of "The Case."
Together, the Summer issue and the forthcoming Autumn issue (due out
in November) look at what the case is; ask how it works--the case
study, the case history, the exemplar; and examine how cases
establish order and disorder, curiosity and research, discipline or
transformative opportunity.
Making the Case The Summer issue, titled Making the Case, looks at
the way cases work in law, medicine, psychoanalysis, physics, popular
culture, public policy, literary criticism and theory, history, art
history, philosophy, and cinema studies.
The Autumn issue, titled Missing Persons, will look at the ways kinds
of people are used as examples of things. What if the working class
were exemplified by servants rather than industrial workers? Why do
ethical philosophers assume that literary characters act just like
humans act? Why do we assume the close-up is an intensification of
the human rather than a weird twisting of it?

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 406 (406)

Last evening, cross-eyed tired, I resorted to the universal anodyne,
television, and found a British series called "Whistleblowers", about
people who righteously rat on those who deserve whatever they get --
which I assume is never enough pain in return for the pain they've
caused. In any case, this evening's pain-giver was a fat-cat
businessman, who invested in "rescuing" schools he had already set on
the skids by dirty-tricks publicity. Once thus rescued, these schools
were turned into efficient operations that taught subjects revised in
accordance with fundamentalist religious principles -- a gratuitous
bit the programme could have done without -- and systematically
eliminated students who would bring their ratings down on what in
this country are called the "league tables" (google for it).
Infamously this included students who needed medical and psychiatric
help. One of them committed suicide, thus provoking the
whistleblowing. In a particularly heated moment, the head teacher of
a rescued school declared that she had no choice because of these
league tables. "Education is a business!" was her concluding statement.
This being the UK, and Blairite doctrine in quiet decline, one hopes,
the attack on the league tables is perfectly understandable. But what
particularly interested me was the over-the-top depiction of the evil
consequences of regarding education as a business that must balance
its books or even show a profit. Having the previous evening sat in
the presence of an old fashioned scholar of immense accomplishment,
simply among the best of his kind, making a comparison was
inescapable. Admittedly I do tend to be idealistic beyond reason even
now, but I cannot help think that someone took the opportunity to put
subversive thoughts into the heads of the Great British Public. May
he or she live long, prosper and do it many times more. A British
Michael Moore in the making?
No, this is not a rant against Business nor against the people who
dedicate their lives to making money. Rather, a logician might say,
it is a quietly impassioned proto-argument that we have made a
fundamental category error in applying the business model to
education. In the instances I have seen close up, this error has
proved to be not merely illogical but also a practical blunder. Of
course by the time anyone will listen, tremendous damage has already
been done.
What has this to do with computing? Only that computing in the
humanities has real potential either of making money or of costing
what in the humanities passes for the earth. So we're vulnerable and
right where the action is. But what does one do? What have those in
the natural sciences who love learning, in a similar position, but
much more so and for much longer, done?
Comments?
Yours,

October 11, 2007
** PROGRAM OFFICER JOB OPENINGS AT THE NEH **
The NEH has just announced that it is seeking to hire TWO (or more) new
program officers (known as "Humanities Administrators" in government
parlance).  NEH program officers help to create and administer grant
programs.  You will be working with scholars across the country (and
sometimes from around the world). You will select peer reviewers, chair
panels, read and review grant proposals, and recommend applications for
funding.  Plus, you get to live in beautiful Washington, DC where all
the museums are free and money grows on trees!  (OK, I made that last
part up).
NEH program officers generally hold advanced degrees in the humanities
and are encouraged to remain active in their field of study.  Germane to
this list, I should note that more and more of the grants we make
involve technology and computing, so having experience in the digital
humanities is a big plus.
One of the openings is in our Division of Research and the other is in
our Division of Education (who are hiring at least one, perhaps more
people).  Salaries are in the range of $66,767 - $103,220.  You can read
further details about each position by checking out this web page:
<a href="http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jobs.html">http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jobs.html</a>
Thank you -- I hope you will consider applying or sending this to
someone who might want to.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 408 (408)

Registration for the National Humanities Center's November Autonomy
Singularity Creativity (ASC) conference is now available online.
The ASC conference, which takes place from November 8-10, includes
some of the most respected and thought-provoking voices from across
the academic spectrum. After its successful inaugural conference in
2006, the Center has expanded the conference to three days of
stimulating events that will allow participants to exchange ideas and
discuss issues surrounding how developments in science are
challenging traditional notions of "the human."
Speakers include scholars from a wide range of disciplines, including
neuroscience, linguistics, primatology, anthropology, computer
science, philosophy, and literary studies. Particular areas of focus
for this year's conference will include panels on animal empathy and
creativity in computers and non-human species, as well as talks about
the considerations and implications for law, policy, the academy, and society.
The conference is open to the public. A registration fee of $30
provides admission to all sessions along with meals during Friday and
Saturday's events.
See <<a href="http://asc.nhc.rtp.nc.us">http://asc.nhc.rtp.nc.us</a>><a href="http://asc.nhc.rtp.nc.us/">http://asc.nhc.rtp.nc.us/</a> for a
schedule of conference activities, including tentative session topics
and speakers, as well as registration materials.
About ASC --
Autonomy, Singularity, Creativity is a project of the National
Humanities Center.
In September of 2006, the Center launched a three year study of ways
that advances in science are changing the limits of human life and
therefore disturbing traditional understandings of what it means to
be human. The initiative gathers scientists and humanists together in
dialogue on these issues. By convening a small group of scholars to
focus on the concepts autonomy, singularity, and creativity --
concepts historically deployed to earmark the boundaries of the human
experience -- we are furthering the development of new knowledge and
generating new understandings of human life.

There are many fields in which the inescapable conclusion is that it 
is both a business AND a professional/artistic endeavor. Film Making 
is often cited as such; as is Making Dictionaries and the classic 
discipline would be Medicine. I don't think one can run down the 
business model since it brings capital in to allow the 
professional/artistic endeavor to reach beyond its innate limits when 
all decisions are made on the basis of what's best for the craft 
without regard to income.
I guess my concept is that it is in charting a course along the 
boundary between profitable and enlightening that the skill of the 
administrators comes into play. If they are corrupt, then of course 
the result is damaged from the beginning, but shunning all funding 
sources isn't the answer either. Balancing how much good will come 
out of the funding source is the challenge.

FOMI 2008 - 3rd Workshop on Formal Ontologies Meet Industry
June 5-6, 2008, Torino, Italy
                FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
Conference web site: <a href="http://www.fomi2008.di.unito.it">http://www.fomi2008.di.unito.it</a>
This event is jointly organized by:
        - Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento
        - University of Torino
        - University of Verona
CONFERENCE AIMS
FOMI is an international forum where academic researchers and
industrial practitioners meet to analyze and discuss issues related
to methods, theories, tools and applications based on formal
ontologies.
There is today wide agreement that knowledge modeling and the
semantic dimension of information plays an increasingly central
role in networked economy: semantic-based applications are relevant
in distributed systems such as networked organizations, organizational
networks, and in distributed knowledge management. These
knowledge models in industry aim to provide a framework for
information and knowledge sharing, reliable information exchange,
meaning negotiation and coordination between distinct organizations or
among members of the same organization.
New tools and applications have been and are being developed in diverse
application fields, ranging from business to medicine, from engineering
to finance, from law to electronics. All these systems have exploited
the theoretical results and the practical experience of previous work.
In all cases, it has been shown that formal ontologies play a
central role in describing in a common and understandable way
the logical and practical features of the application domain.
The success of the methodologies associated with knowledge modeling
and ontologies led to increased need of a comparison between different
approaches and results, with the aim of evaluating the interdependencies
between theories and methods of formal ontology and the activities,
processes, and needs of enterprise organizations.
The FOMI 08 Workshop aims to advance in this direction by bringing
together researchers and practitioners interested in ontology
application, paying particular attention to the topics listed below.
CONFERENCE TOPICS
*problems in ontology application:*
   - practical issues in using ontologies in the enterprise
   - real cases of successful/unsuccessful use of ontology in business
   - from legacy systems to the new ontology-driven systems
*ontology and business:*
   - ontology and ontological methodologies in business;
   - adaptation of ontologies for companies and organizations;
   - ontology effectiveness and evaluation in business
*ontology and enterprise:*
   - ontology-driven enterprise modeling;
   - ontology development and change within organizations;
   - ontology-driven representation of products, services,
functionalities,
        design, processes;
*ontology and enterprise knowledge:*
   - ontologies for the know-how;
   - ontologies for corporate knowledge;
*ontology in practice:*
   - ontologies for electronic catalogs, e-commerce, e-government;
   - ontologies for marketing;
   - ontologies for finance;
   - ontologies for engineering;
   - ontologies for medical sciences;
*ontology and linguistics:*
   - ontology-driven linguistic representation in organization knowledge;
   - linguistic problems in standards and in codification processes;
   - ontologies and multilingualism in business and organizations

[deleted quotation]This has been getting a lot of negative criticism in the list HEL-L,
the History of English discussion list.
It would take a lot of space and time to repeat all the problems we
have indicated with what we can make of the study from the little
blurb, but a great deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed about
the authors' lack of knowledge of the history of English (for
instance, they could easily have found out Chaucer's dates),. about
the fact that the relative rates of change in the past participles of
common strong verbs versus uncommon ones has been known to historical
linguists for at least a century, the dearth of valuable diachronic
databases of English from which a careful study could be made, and
even some of the authors' statistical remarks.
In other words, the thing is getting a bad press among many
historical linguists. (And many of us feel that Nature would do well
not to accept papers in fields the editors and readers do not understand.)

The core of DDQ 6(3) is the beginning of a critique of Information
Science.  This critique, planned to continue in future DDQ numbers,
explores the proposition that Information Science will not resolve
current uncertainties about its place as an academic discipline on a
par with Computer Science, but instead will fade within two decades,
with its concerns becoming topics in more enduring university faculties.
Information Science professionals who believe this prediction
mistaken might wish to present counter-arguments to what appears in
DDQ.  To them, I suggest that Information Science will fade unless
they can produce justifications and scoping statements much more
robust than any I have read.  Should they want DDQ to publish or cite
of their refutations, I will be happy to include them provided that
they accommodate the compact DDQ style.
Readers are reminded that embedded links provide quick access to
other authors' discussions of topics that DDQ mentions, in case they

Editor's Note
--Judith Turner
We've been discussing the future of e-books among
ourselves at JEP, and are coming to the reluctant
(at least to us, bibliophiles all) conclusion
that with the advent of electronic publishing, a
whole class of print books should be on its way out.
One of my colleagues says that book excerpts,
chapters, and even many monographs would work
fine as long articles. Another thinks that with
the slicing and dicing most of us do in research,
we tend to make our own books out of the material that interests us.
I find that many monographs are just a
convenience, a series of ideas linked together,
sometimes somewhat tenuously, sometimes raggedly,
by the convention of "book" =97 the printing and
sale of a collection of ideas. Many of those
books bring to mind one of those famous lines,
repeated in various fashions by people like
Thoreau, Pascal, and Nietzsche, about how if you
have more time you can write shorter. How many
ideas need book-length treatment? How many could
be long theses, tractates, or essays, but are
pushed to 200-400 pages because publishers have a
problem selling "slim" volumes?
Perhaps e-books are the harbinger of fewer books.
If a publisher can sell two "themes" in a
collection of "e-books" rather than one "book,"
might not that collection seem more important, and therefore more valuable?
When an issue of JEP provokes such thinking, I
think it's a winner. I expect you will, too.
Here's a rundown of what you will find in Volume
10, issue 3 of The Journal of Electronic
Publishing <<a href="http://www.journalofelectronicpublishing.org/">http://www.journalofelectronicpublishing.org/</a>>.
Kathleen Fitzpatrick's New (Social) Structures
for New (Networked) Texts makes the point that
electronic publishing is fundamentally a social
process, which takes it miles from the paper
publishing that she says creates the =93bookness of
the book.=94 It's an intriguing thesis, and one
that is explored from different directions.
Kathleen is accepting comments on the paper at
<a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/commentpress">http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/commentpress</a>.

One of those explorers is John Dawson, a
professor at the University of Guelph. In
Electronic Publishing as Course Content, he
explains how he devotes part of his Protein and
Nucleic Acid Structure course to giving
undergraduates an idea of what it is like to
publish in the electronic environment. For
Dawson's students, the scientific process has a
strong communication element=97and it's been an
eye-opener for them. Not surprisingly, it is the
process of publishing electronically, and not the
writing itself, that seems to most intrigue
students. There may be a message here.

Students in journalism schools also need to
understand e-publishing, and Rick Musser and
Staci Martin-Wolfe have found that a
blog-publishing package allows them to teach the
fine points of writing, reporting, and
communicating on line, again with a strong
interactive element. They describe their approach
in Blogs as a Student Content Management System.

In their literature review, Lynn Silipigni
Connaway and Heather L. Wicht attempt to answer
the question What Happened to the E-Book
Revolution? Their exposition of how e-books have
fared in library collections show that the
acceptance has been more gradual than many
predicted. I wonder if that is because =93books=94
are something else when they are electronic.

Mark Sandler, Kim Armstrong, and Bob Nardini
probe that same question from the point of view
of the market factors that influence the adoption
of e-books in Market Formation for E-Books:
Diffusion, Confusion or Delusion?, and conclude,
in part, that the merchandise and the medium are
not yet well matched. <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3336451.0010.310">http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3336451.0010.310</a>
Perhaps, writes Matthew Mayernik, it's because we
haven't adequately exploited the possibilities of
e-publishing. He looks at what journals have done

Dear colleagues,
My apologies for the rather lurching rhythm of Humanist these days. A
hard-disc crash put one of its mechanisms out of service for a time,
with a bit of a mess resulting, and of course delays in getting
messages out to you. Now things seem back to normal. One day, I hope
soon, we'll be getting a shiny new engine, which I trust will mean no
visible changes for you other than a more reliable delivery of the
messages. And then I can enjoy the luxury of being nostalgic about
the years when the whole thing was a hodge-podge of home-made parts.
(Indeed, a major part of the machinery of Humanist was made right
here, in this room, by a kind visitor in exchange for a place to stay.)
There is an television advert here made by some high-tech company
that deliberately harkens back to the days when radio and television
technology barely worked, with much hum and static, and those who
appeared or only spoke were barely trained. You'll see a placard held
unsteadily in front of the camera by someone's hand while the audio
hums away because it's not been properly earthed/grounded, and there
will be much "snow", as I recall it was called. The net-effect is
supposed to be charming, I guess, down-home, unthreatening etc. I
find it intensely annoying, silly, stupid etc. But it does serve as a
reminder of how far electronic engineering has brought us. Sharp,
clear images are so much a matter of course that we forget how much
work and ingenuity was required to make it so. But it's not just that
we've lost awareness of what's happening behind the scenes. I'm told
that I am not the only one who feels mentally deranged when one of my
computers does not work. It's almost as if my mind has extended
itself to assimilate the computer, making the machine part of itself,
and so a breakdown in the latter seem a breakdown in the former. I
suppose this is a contemporary version of the well-known
blindman-and-his-stick metaphor used by the phenomenologists.
Fortunately for my mental state, there must be a sort of
inverse-square law for computing, so that the failure of physically
very distant systems does not affect me as much as failures here.
When parts of Humanist break, I just feel isolated and, I admit,
enjoy the bit of silence while it lasts. Shocking! But thanks to
Shayne Brandon, the old engine at Virginia has sputtered into life
again, so once again I make my morning rounds.
Yours,

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 420 (420)

Having just read the article, I'd second Norman's concerns. Two
simple examples must suffice:
1. The authors use the dates 800, 1200, and 2000 as the dates at
which they check for the regular vs irregular status of a verb. The
earliest written records of Old English are usually dated to about
700, but clearly OE existed before that. The larger problem is with
the dates for Middle English and Modern English. It makes sense to
use 1200 as the beginning date for Middle English, but Modern English
is normally considered to begin around 1500. So their calculations
are based on a late beginning for Old, an early beginning for Middle,
and a 500 year late date for Modern English. Equations for rates of
change based on these figures are, to say the least, debatable, and
one would need further explanation of the choices.
2. The only date at which actually sampling for frequency is done is
for Modern English (from COBUILD, roughly 1980-present). The authors
merely looked for an entry in a reference book that indicated whether
a verb was regular or irregular in Old, Middle, and Modern English
(800, 1200, 2000). Thus the equations apparently assume that each
verb's frequency remained constant over the 1200 years they study. It
is obviously reasonable to suggest that infrequent verbs are less
resistant to regularization (they occur so seldom that it is easier
for children to use regular forms analogically without finding out
that the verbs are historically irregular). But one might have liked
a check of the relative frequencies of some verbs in Old English or
Middle English to see whether there is any close relationship between
the frequencies in OE and Modern English, for example.
The controversy may prove instructive, at any rate.

Abstract Deadline: November 18, 2007 (Midnight Universal Time)
Presentations can include:
* Single papers (abstract, min. of 750 words, max. of 1500 words)
* Multiple paper sessions (overview, min. of 750 words, max. of 1500
words)
* Posters (abstract, min. of 750 words, max. of 1500 words)
Call for Papers Announcement
I. General
The international Programme Committee invites submissions of abstracts
of between 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of humanities computing and
the digital humanities, broadly defined to encompass the common ground
between information technology and issues in humanities research and
teaching. As always, we welcome submissions in any area of the
humanities, particularly interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage
submissions on the current state of the art in humanities computing and
the digital humanities, and on recent and expected future developments
in the field.
Suitable subjects for proposals include, for example,
* text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing,
language learning
* creation, delivery and management of humanities digital resources
* collaboration between libraries and scholars in the creation,
delivery, and management of humanities digital resources
* computer-based research and computing applications in all areas of
literary, linguistic, cultural, and historical studies, including
interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship
* use of computation in such areas as the arts, architecture, music,
film, theatre, new media, and other areas reflecting our cultural
heritage
* research issues such as: information design and modelling; the
cultural impact of the new media
* the role of digital humanities in academic curricula
Proposals should report significant and substantive results and will
include reference to pertinent work in the field (up to 10 items) as
part of their critical assessment.
The range of topics covered by humanities computing can also be
consulted in the journal of the associations: Literary and Linguistic
Computing (LLC), Oxford University Press.
The deadline for submitting paper, session and poster proposals to the
Programme Committee is November 18, 2007 (midnight Universal Time). All
submissions will be refereed. Presenters will be notified of acceptance
by February by 13, 2008.
The electronic submission form will be available at the conference site
from October 15th, 2007. See below for full details on submitting
proposals.
Proposals for (non-refereed, or vendor) demos and for pre-conference
tutorials and workshops should be discussed directly with the local
conference organizer as soon as possible.
For more information on the conference in general please visit the
conference web site, at <a href="http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/">http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/</a>.
II. Types of Proposals
Proposals to the Programme Committee may be of three types: (1) papers,
(2) poster presentations and/or software demonstrations (poster/demos),
and (3) sessions (either three-paper or panel sessions). The type of
submission must be specified in the proposal.
Proposals to the Programme Committee may be presented in English and any
of the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian,
Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Conference presentations may be in these
languages as well, and the Programme Committee encourages presenters to
consider multilingual presentations (for example, a presentation in one
language with accompanying slides or handouts accommodating speakers of
another language).
1) Papers
Proposals for papers (750-1500 words) should describe original work:
either completed research which has given rise to substantial results,
or the development of significant new methodologies, or rigorous
theoretical, speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers will
be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.
Proposals that concentrate on the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied to
research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include some
critical assessment of the application of those methodologies in the
humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular application in the
humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches
to the problem and should include some critical assessment of the
computing methodologies used. All proposals should include conclusions
and references to important sources. Those describing the creation or
use of digital resources should follow these guidelines as far as
possible.
2) Poster Presentations and Software Demonstrations (Poster/Demos)
Poster presentations may include computer technology and project
demonstrations. The term poster/demo refers to the different possible
combinations of printed and computer based presentations. The
poster/demo sessions build on the recent trend of showcasing some of the
most important and innovative work being done in humanities computing.
By definition, poster presentations and project demonstrations are less
formal and more interactive than a standard talk. They provide the
opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss
their work in detail with those most deeply interested in the same
topic. Presenters will be provided with about two square meters of board
space to display their work. They may also provide handouts with
examples or more detailed information. Poster/demos will remain on
display throughout the conference, but there will also be a separate
conference session dedicated to them, when presenters should be prepared
to explain their work and answer questions. Additional times may also be
assigned for software or project demonstrations.
There should be no difference in quality between poster/demo
presentations and papers, and the format for proposals is the same for
both. The same academic standards should apply in both cases, but
posters/demos may be a more suitable way of presenting late-breaking
results, or significant work in progress, including pedagogical
applications. Both will be submitted to the same refereeing process. The
choice between the two modes of presentation (poster/demo or paper)
should depend on the most effective and informative way of communicating
the scientific content of the proposal.
As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters and
demonstrations to the conference, the Programme Committee will award a
prize for the best poster.
3) Sessions
Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:
Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for
each paper, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in
the session;
Or
A panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each
speaker is willing to participate in the session.
The deadline for session proposals is the same as for proposals for
papers, i.e. November 18, 2007.
III. Format of the Proposals
All proposals must be submitted electronically using the on-line
submission form, which will be available from October 15th, 2007 at:
<a href="https://secure.digitalhumanities.org/conftool/">https://secure.digitalhumanities.org/conftool/</a>
Those who registered as authors, reviewers or participants at the DH2007
conference are kindly asked to log on to their existing account (the one
used for the DH2007 conference) rather than making up a new account.
IV. Bursaries for Young Scholars
A limited number of bursaries for young scholars will be made available
to those presenting at the conference. If you wish to be considered for
a bursary, please refer to information about the bursary schemes
available from the Association for Computing in the Humanities
(<a href="http://www.ach.org/ach_bursary/">http://www.ach.org/ach_bursary/</a>) and the Association for Literary and
Linguistic Computing (_<a href="http://www.allc.org/awards/bursary.htm">http://www.allc.org/awards/bursary.htm</a>_).
Applications may be made to either the ACH or the ALLC, but not both
organizations.

The annual international conference and course Libraries in the Digital
Age (LIDA) addresses the changing and challenging environment for
libraries and information systems and services in the digital world. Since
its inception in 2000, LIDA has emphasized the examination of contemporary
problems, intriguing advances, innovative approaches and solutions. Each
year a different and =91hot=92 theme is addressed, divided in two parts; the
first part covers research and development and the second part addresses
advances in applications and practice. LIDA brings together researchers,
educators, practitioners, and developers from all over the world in a
forum for personal exchanges, discussions, and learning, made easier by
being held in memorable locations.
Themes LIDA 2008
Part I: Education and training in digital libraries
In a relatively short period of time, spanning less than two decades or
so, digital libraries became a global phenomenon, characterized by an
accelerated, explosive growth. Digital libraries are a subject of great
many activities worldwide. These include diverse practical applications,
research and development (R&D) on many fronts, continuing innovation,
policy formulations, management changes, and more. A number of fields are
involved, among the most prominent being information science,
librarianship, and computer science.
Considerable and rapidly growing amounts of funds are spent on practical
applications in building and operating a variety of digital library
collections, components and service and on R&D in digital libraries. Many
commercial enterprises are providing digital resources and software for
digital libraries. This all creates demands for well educated and trained
professionals in these areas.
However, the education and training for digital libraries is most often
based on apprentiship and practical courses and conferences without
receiving the same attention (and resources) of digital libraries
applications and other areas mentioned. A number of institutions are
teaching digital libraries modules and courses, or beginning to, and
struggling with this relatively new and volatile educational area. Many
practitioners are finding it hard to learn more and to keep up.
The goal of the first part of LIDA 2008 is to explore efforts, concepts
and ideas related to education and training of professionals, dealing with
the academic quality standards and practical training requirements for
digital libraries and in variety of fields and contexts related to
knowledge, values and skills needed for digital librarians. The general
aim is to help further development of current efforts, as well as
development of frameworks within which diverse efforts could be compared,
evaluated, and improved.
Contributions are invited covering the following topics (types described
below):
=95knowledge, values and skills of the digital librarian to be reflected in
educational offerings
=95conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches to digital library
education
=95instructional design, development, and evaluation of programs of study
and specialization for digital librarians in a variety of schools and on
different levels =AD existing and proposed
=95convergence and place of digital library education in broader curricula
of library and information science, computer science, and other fields;
impact of digital library education on other parts of the curriculum
=95examples of good practices of specific courses (or sequence of
courses)and programs related to various aspects of digital libraries and
digital library technology; examples of various modes of delivery
=95continuing education and training in digital libraries oriented toward
practicing professionals
=95student evaluation of digital library education, as well as expectations
and perceptions of professionals in continuing education courses and
efforts
=95international aspects and cooperative opportunities in digital library
education
=95benchmarking and evaluation of educational and training programs in
digital libraries
=95cultural and social elements in digital library education.
Part II: Reference in digital environments
As access to electronic information through library Web pages has
proliferated in recent years, an increasing number of libraries have added
digital reference assistance to their list of user services. E-mail
reference has become an expected venue for asking reference questions,
having been included among the suite of information services for over 20
years. Live chat reference services are relatively new-comers, but have
already been successfully operating for over 10 years. Information seekers
are increasingly turning to virtual reference (also known as digital
reference) for the anonymity and convenience of remote access and for the
extended hours of operation, since many services operate 24/7/365. An
increasing number of libraries and information centers are now
experimenting with Instant Messaging, Text Messaging (SMS), and other
emerging modes for offering reference services to increasingly tech savvy
library users. Web 2.0 applications are opening new vistas for digital
library services including reference blogs and wikis. Digital reference
desks are appearing in virtual worlds such as Second Life. Although the
proliferation of these alternative methods for service delivery highlights
the need for research focused on understanding users and staff behavior
and impact on issues of satisfaction and success, their assessment poses
new challenges for researchers.
The goal of the second part of LIDA 2008 is to explore the totality of the
virtual reference environment (including live chat, e-mail, IM, and Web
2.0 reference initiatives) and its relationship to digital libraries.
Special attention will be on the evaluation of virtual reference services
from a variety of research perspectives and approaches. The general aim is
to concentrate on scholarship that increases our understanding of the
needs, interests, and experiences of users as well as
librarians/information providers in the context of virtual reference.
Invited are contributions (types described below) covering the following
topics:
=95evaluation of various modes of digital library services
=95application of theories and models in study of users and use of virtual
reference
=95application of theories and user information needs assessments for design
and development of digital reference systems
=95assessment of the decision making process for users who choose virtual
reference over other modes (e.g., face-to-face, phone)
=95advantages and disadvantages of different virtual reference modes =95the
role of knowledge databases in digital reference
=95sustainability and cost-effectiveness of virtual reference services
=95evaluation of virtual reference consortia and comparison of service
models
=95benchmarking service quality and development of evaluation standards in
virtual reference
=95evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of different virtual reference
modes
=95assessment of the quality of  interpersonal communication in virtual
reference
=95studies of accuracy and efficiency in virtual reference
=95explorations of question negotiation in virtual environments
=95issues in archiving digital reference questions.

Venues
The first part of LIDA 2008 will be held in Dubrovnik and for the second
part the conference will move to island Mljet, less than a two-hour ride
from Dubrovnik on a fast catamaran. Pre-conference workshops are planned
for 26 May 2008 in Dubrovnik and post-conference workshops for 31 May 2008
on Mljet.
Dubrovnik, Croatia is recognized as one of the World Cultural Heritage
sites by UNESCO. It is a walled city, preserved as it existed in medieval
times. A beautiful natural location on the Adriatic Sea, a lavish
architecture of squares, palaces, and churches, small, intriguing

<a href="http://www.elpub.net">http://www.elpub.net</a>
Scholarly communications, in particular scholarly publications, are
undergoing tremendous changes. Researchers, universities, funding bodies,
research libraries and publishers are responding in different ways, from
active experimentation, adaptation, to strong resistance. The ELPUB2008
conference will focus on key issues on the future of scholarly
communications resulting from the intersection of semantic web technologies,
the development of cyberinfrastructure for humanities and the sciences, and
new dissemination channels and business models. We welcome a wide variety of
papers from members of these communities whose research and experiments are
transforming the nature of scholarly communications. Topics include but are
not restricted to:
--    New Publishing models, tools, services and roles
--    New scholarly constructs and discourse methods
--    Innovative business models for scholarly publishing
--    Multilingual and multimodal interfaces
--    Services and technology for specific user communities, media, and
       content
--    Content search, analysis and retrieval
--    Interoperability, scalability and middleware infrastructure to
       facilitate awareness and discovery
--    Personalisation technologies (e.g. social tagging, folksonomies, RSS,
       microformats)
--    Metadata creation, usage and interoperability
--    Semantic web issues
--    Data mining, text harvesting, and dynamic formatting
--    User generated content and its relation to publisher's content

ABOUT ELPUB
The ELPUB 2008 conference will keep the tradition of the previous
international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the United
Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999), Russia (2000),
the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil (2004), Belgium (2005),
Bulgaria (2006) and Austria (2007), which is to bring together researchers,
lecturers, librarians, developers, business executives, entrepreneurs,
managers, users and all those interested in issues regarding electronic
publishing in a wide variety of contexts. These include the human, cultural,
economic, social, technological, legal, commercial, and other relevant
aspects that such an exciting theme encompasses.
Three distinguishing features of this conference are: broad scope of topics
which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and learning about
various aspects of scholarly communications and electronic publishing;
combination of general and technical issues; and a condensed procedure of
submission, revision and publication of proceedings which guarantees
presentations of most recent work.
ELPUB 2008 offers a variety of activities, such as workshops, tutorials,
panel debates, poster presentation and demonstrations.  A variety of social
events and sight-seeing tours will be available to participants (at
additional costs). Please see the conference web site for details.
Conference Location: Toronto, Canada. Toronto is one of the most vibrant
cities in North-America. It has a large multicultural population, is the
largest city in Canada and the 5th-largest city in North America. There are

Enhancing and Supporting e-Research
King's College London is pleased to announce the establishment of the KCL
Centre for e-Research.  Based in Information Systems and Services, the
Centre will lead on building an e-research environment and data management
infrastructure at King's, seeking to harness the potential of IT to enhance
research and teaching practice across the College.  The Centre also has a
remit to make a significant contribution to national, European and
international agendas for e-research, and in particular to carry forward in
a new context the work of the AHDS across the arts and humanities.
To that end, the Centre will incorporate the Arts and Humanities Data
Service Executive and its related projects, thus providing a secure
institutional framework for the projects, and a platform for developing
future services and projects when funding for the AHDS ceases at the end of
March 2008.  The Centre will seek to carry forward the legacy of the AHDS
and to use its expertise and skills to explore a new framework and funding
model for the support of ICT based around communities of practice, a network
of expert centres, and the emerging set of institutional repositories.
The Centre will be directed by Sheila Anderson, currently Director of the
Arts and Humanities Data Service.  Lorna Hughes (currently Manager of the
Methods Network) and Mark Hedges (currently Technical Manager at the AHDS)
will join the Centre as Deputy Directors.
Planning for the new Centre began on 1st October 2007 and a major launch
event is planned for Spring 2008.  Further information and news about the
Centre and its activities will be released over the coming months.

Dear Friends of Telos,
Our Fall issue (#140) has just appeared, a
special issue on Peter Szondi and Critical
Hermeneutics. This is a first in the
English-speaking world. Szondi was a defining
figure in German literary criticism, especially
during the 1960s, and his work is currently
undergoing an exciting rediscovery on both sides
of the Atlantic. I have posted the Introduction
on our website, <<a href="http://www.telospress.com/">http://www.telospress.com/</a>><a href="http://www.telospress.com">http://www.telospress.com</a> .
Our book line continues to grow. Jean-Claude
Paye's Global War on Liberty is the most
comprehensive account of the expanding network of
security and surveillance that threatens civil
liberties everywhere. Our new translation of Carl
Schmitt's Theory of the Partisan has added an
important dimension to current political debate.
And on November 1, we will proudly present
Matthias K=FCntzel's Jihad and Jew-Hatred:
Islamism, Nazism and the Roots of 9/11, with an
introduction by Jeffrey Herf. This book=ADa
translation from the German with considerable
expansion=ADpoints to the central role of
antisemitism in the jihadist ideology behind contemporary terrorism.
Next year, not only will we be going online
through cooperation with HighWire Press, but we
will also celebrate our fortieth anniversary!
We've been at it since May of 1968. To recognize
this milestone, we will publish an anthology of
the writings of Paul Piccone, founder and
long-time editor of Telos. We will also offer a
free print subscription to the journal along with
purchase of the anthology. Watch our website for more details.
And our next issues are already in the works.
Upcoming themes: environmentalism, terrorism, a
special issue on Carl Schmitt, the legacy of
1968, Latin America, and more. Stay tuned.
Best wishes,
Russell A. Berman
Editor

This volume is dedicated to the theoretical legacy of Ferdinand de
Saussure, which is still challenging not only for linguistics, but for many
other disciplines. For Saussure, to conceive language as a system made
it possible to found linguistics as an autonomous scientific
discipline. However, if language could be seen and treated as a system, it had
consequences not only for linguistics, but also for esthetics,
anthropology, or cultural theory. With respect to Czech functional
structualism,
as developed by Jan Mukarovsky and others, it seems important that it
was in Prague that Saussurean thinking on language came in touch with
phenomenological philosophy. Since Husserl's work was already
authoritative at the beginning of the 30th, the confrontation of Saussure's
theory of language with phenomenological reflections on language was
inevitable. The interaction between structuralism and phenomenology then
continued, above all, in the philosophical work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty
. But if the interaction between s
tructuralist theory and phenomenology is in focus of this volume, it is
not so much for historical reasons; it is rather due to a mapping of
the possible views of language that issue from the confrontation of
structuralist and phenomenological tradition of thinking. With regard to
language, a high attention is paid to the post-phenomenological and the
post-structuarlist theories, too.

Knowledge Organization (ISKO): Call for Papers
Dear Colleagues,
Please find attached the Call for Papers of the German chapter of the
International Society of Knowledge Organization (ISKO). While this is
not an eHumanities conference in the strict sense, many of its topics
are very pertinent to our field.
Best regards,
Marc K=FCster
--------------------
English Version (abridged):
February 20th through 22nd, 2008, the ISKO conference will take place at
Constance (Germany). The conference is organized by the German chapter
of ISKO, the Library Service Centre Baden-W=FCrttemberg, and the
Department of Information Science at the University of Konstanz.
The general topic is:
Repositories of knowledge in digital spaces
Accessibility, sustainability, semantic interoperability
The following sessions (and special topics) are planned:
a. Ontologies, controlled vocabulary, topic maps, semantic web
Ontologies, classifications, topic maps, and the semantic web seem to
enhance the usefulness and the usability of online knowledge. The
different communities of developers often don't know anything about each
other although there might be chances of fruitful cooperation.
Ontologies and classifications (UDC, DDC) are a instruments of knowlegde
organization and universal views on knowledge structures. Topic maps
offer new and user friendly strategies of retrieval. The semantic web
seems to be split between promise and reality. Successful applications
are therefore of interest.
B. Social tagging
Folksonomies and wikies can be perceived as a way of democratization of
knowledge. Nevertheless the producers of this knowledge control the
structure of knowledge which is a debatable point. Another one is,
whether the sustainability of knowledge can be guaranteed under the
circumstances of an anarchic process of knowledge creation. Political
questions like these are of interest.
C. Platforms of knowledge
There are several platforms and environments, where online knowledge is
used enriching and organizing it for new purposes. Therefore
contributions for some of those platforms such as e-learning,
e-scholarship, e-publishing are welcome.
D. Applications and projects
Developers of new applications and services are invited to share their
knowledge with the participants of the conference. European projects
like MINERVA, the European Digital Library etc. try to offer digitized
knowledge and are good examples of the development into the direction of
global stores of knowledge.
All those interested in the above mentioned topics or those running
relevant projects are invited to participate in and contribute to the
conference. English contributions as well as talks or session proposals
in other fields of knowledge organization and related matters are also
welcome. Please send a proposal with title, author, address details and
an abstract of up to one page length till
November 30th, 2007
Organizer: Dr. J=F6rn Sieglerschmidt, <joern.sieglerschmidt AT

Call for Papers Announcement
I. General
The international Programme Committee invites submissions of abstracts
of between 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of humanities computing and
the digital humanities, broadly defined to encompass the common ground
between information technology and issues in humanities research and
teaching. As always, we welcome submissions in any area of the
humanities, particularly interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage
submissions on the current state of the art in humanities computing and
the digital humanities, and on recent and expected future developments
in the field.
Suitable subjects for proposals include, for example,
* text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing,
    language learning
* creation, delivery and management of humanities digital resources
* collaboration between libraries and scholars in the creation,
    delivery, and management of humanities digital resources
* computer-based research and computing applications in all areas of
    literary, linguistic, cultural, and historical studies, including
    interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship
* use of computation in such areas as the arts, architecture, music,
    film, theatre, new media, and other areas reflecting our cultural
    heritage
* research issues such as: information design and modelling; the
    cultural impact of the new media
* the role of digital humanities in academic curricula
Proposals should report significant and substantive results and will
include reference to pertinent work in the field (up to 10 items) as
part of their critical assessment.
The range of topics covered by humanities computing can also be
consulted in the journal of the associations: Literary and Linguistic
Computing (LLC), Oxford University Press.
The deadline for submitting paper, session and poster proposals to the
Programme Committee is November 18, 2007 (midnight Universal Time).
All submissions will be refereed. Presenters will be notified of acceptance
by February by 13, 2008.
The electronic submission form will be available at the conference site
from October 15th, 2007. See below for full details on submitting
proposals.
Proposals for (non-refereed, or vendor) demos and for pre-conference
tutorials and workshops should be discussed directly with the local
conference organizer as soon as possible.
For more information on the conference in general please visit the
conference web site, at <a href="http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/">http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/</a>.
II. Types of Proposals
Proposals to the Programme Committee may be of three types: (1) papers,
(2) poster presentations and/or software demonstrations (poster/demos),
and (3) sessions (either three-paper or panel sessions). The type of
submission must be specified in the proposal.
Proposals to the Programme Committee may be presented in English and
any of the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian,
Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Conference presentations may be in these
languages as well, and the Programme Committee encourages presenters
to consider multilingual presentations (for example, a presentation in one
language with accompanying slides or handouts accommodating speakers
of another language).
1) Papers
Proposals for papers (750-1500 words) should describe original work:
either completed research which has given rise to substantial results,
or the development of significant new methodologies, or rigorous
theoretical, speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers will
be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.
Proposals that concentrate on the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied to
research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include some
critical assessment of the application of those methodologies in the
humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular application in the
humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches
to the problem and should include some critical assessment of the
computing methodologies used. All proposals should include conclusions
and references to important sources. Those describing the creation or
use of digital resources should follow these guidelines as far as
possible.
2) Poster Presentations and Software Demonstrations (Poster/Demos)
Poster presentations may include computer technology and project
demonstrations. The term poster/demo refers to the different possible
combinations of printed and computer based presentations. The
poster/demo sessions build on the recent trend of showcasing some of
the most important and innovative work being done in humanities computing.
By definition, poster presentations and project demonstrations are less
formal and more interactive than a standard talk. They provide the
opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss
their work in detail with those most deeply interested in the same
topic. Presenters will be provided with about two square meters of board
space to display their work. They may also provide handouts with
examples or more detailed information. Poster/demos will remain on
display throughout the conference, but there will also be a separate
conference session dedicated to them, when presenters should be prepared
to explain their work and answer questions. Additional times may also be
assigned for software or project demonstrations.
There should be no difference in quality between poster/demo
presentations and papers, and the format for proposals is the same for
both. The same academic standards should apply in both cases, but
posters/demos may be a more suitable way of presenting late-breaking
results, or significant work in progress, including pedagogical
applications. Both will be submitted to the same refereeing process. The
choice between the two modes of presentation (poster/demo or paper)
should depend on the most effective and informative way of communicating
the scientific content of the proposal.
As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters and
demonstrations to the conference, the Programme Committee will award a
prize for the best poster.
3) Sessions
Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:
Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for
each paper, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in
the session;

Vectors: Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular is
pleased to announce the launch of its new issue devoted to the theme of
Difference: <a href="http://www.vectorsjournal.org">http://www.vectorsjournal.org</a>
Our fifth issue of Vectors stages multiple examinations of the notion
of difference as it plays out in a variety of spheres, discourses and
practices, while also privileging race and ethnicity as a central
through-line of digital culture, a recurring ghost in our networked
machines.. Featured scholars include David Theo Goldberg/Stefka
Hristova, Wendy Chun, Mark Kann, Jon Ippolito, Minoo Moallem,
Jennifer Terry and Christian Sandvig. Vectors is produced by editors
Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson, co-creative directors Erik Loyer
and Raegan Kelly, and programmer Craig Dietrich with additional
design by Alex Ceglia.
Vectors is an international peer-reviewed electronic journal
dedicated to expanding the potentials of academic publication via
emergent and transitional media. Vectors brings together visionary
scholars with cutting-edge designers and technologists to propose a
thorough rethinking of the dynamic relationship of form to content in
academic research, focusing on the ways technology shapes, transforms
and reconfigures social and cultural relations.  We only publish
works that exceed the boundaries of print.
Please also explore previous issues in the Vectors Archive and
contribute to an ongoing dialogue with the project creators via the
Vectors Forums.
Feel free to share this announcement widely.

<a href="http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/lit_tech.html">http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/lit_tech.html</a>
Following from an earlier study of "literate
technologies," the present volume seeks to
examine a number of questions that inevitably
come to surround any discussion of signification
and dynamic systems; questions which concern the
relationship between what is variously meant by
the terms event and state, and which tend to
coalesce around a number of "problems" to do with
relativity and the discursive character of time
or temporalisation, mediality, representation and
the "techno-logisation" of presence. Such
questions ultimately travel far afield, between
ontology and classical epistemology, cybernetics
and quantum physics, poetics and political science.
Essays in this volume treat the work of Alain
Badiou, Bernard Stiegler, Thomas Pynchon, Martin
Heidegger, Karl Marx, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,
Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Jose Delgado,
Friedrich Kittler, Jean-Luc Godard.
Louis Armand is director of the InterCultural
Studies programme in the Philosophy Faculty of
Charles University, Prague. His books include
Solicitations: Essays on Criticism & Culture;
Techne: James Joyce, Hypertext & Technology; and
Incendiary Devices: Discourses of the Other. He

Dear Willard,
I would connect this to Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment and
the place of it in the discussion of AI. If I was addressing digital
humanists I would point out how an early experiment of the late 1940s
in the digital humanities by Andrew Booth and company actually tested
an algorithm for machine translation with "a human untutored in the
languages concerned, who applied only those rules which could
eventually be performed by a machine." (_Mechanical Resolution of
Linguistic Problems_ 1958) Booth (who it could be argued is before
Busa in applying computing to humanities problems) set up the
experiment so that the human would not learn, but would behave as the
machine in order to test a hypothesis about the machine where he
didn't have access to the machine. He was, to borrow from your work,
modeling the machine through the human. Searle's thought experiment
to illustrate the difference between AI and HI sounds inspired by
what was an actual practice in the days when you couldn't afford
computing time.
Did Booth's humans learn the languages they were pretending to
translate as a machine? Did they learn something other than the
language? And ... how do we know that Russell's machine isn't
learning just because it does things the same way? Perhaps the wear
and tear of the machine is its learning.
Yours,
Geoffrey R.

Subject: job as Online Development Manager at OUP
Date: Wed, 24 Oct 2007 05:55:45 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 438 (438)

We are currently in the process of recruiting an Online Development
Manager (ODM) for the academic and trade department at Oxford
University Press. The position is a new one, designed to help the
department maximise its online potential over the coming years, and
ensure that we are well placed to respond swiftly and effectively to
changes in the market. Online publishing is already an extremely
important part of our business, with success in the area achieved
through Oxford Scholarship Online (alongside an extensive suite of
online products from the Press more widely) and there are a number of
extensive development plans currently on the table.
The ODM will be responsible for the development and implementation of
the Press's Academic and Trade electronic product strategy in the UK.
They will work with the editorial project sponsors and liaise with
key groups in our technology department - the Electronic Product
Development (EPD) team and Data Management Group (DTG) - to take
forward online plans for a broad range of content from Very Short
Introductions to scholarly editions. The ODM will be supported by two
members of staff.
Key objectives for the role will include:
--       planning and initiating research and concept testing,
--       analysis of market intelligence,
--       formation of commercial product requirements, and
--       liaison with EPD and DMG at the business requirement level
and during the product life cycle (including product design, project
management, data sourcing, data reusability and access).
[The advert] for this role ... appears in the
Guardian this week, and closes on Friday 2 November. I would stress
that the salary indicator on the advert was decided upon very much
with the Guardian audience in mind, i.e. we would usually expect a
range of applicants from the Guardian with very different levels of
experience. For the right candidate, we would be prepared to pay a
significantly higher salary.

Today, the machine will ask you for your credit card number, tell you
what you have purchased before or which trains you took. It will make
all kind of more or less ridiculous suggestions where to spend your
next coin and the next. It will communicate with other machines in
your house to collect more information about you, relay this to still
other machines and store it indefinitely.
The man at the ticket office, on the contrary, has learned from

Image Interpolation Algorithms
Professors Tunku Acharya (Avisere Inc and
Aritzona State University) and Ping-Sing Tsai
(University of Texas, Pan American) explain that
interpolation algorithms can be grouped into two
categories, adaptive or non-adaptive "The
computational logic of an adaptive image
interpolation technique is mostly dependent upon
the intrinsic image features and contents of the
input image whereas computational logic of a
non-adaptive image interpolation technique is
fixed irrespective of the input image features".
They discuss the progress of both non-adaptive
and adaptive image interpolation techniques,
propose a new algorithm for image interpolation
in a discrete wavelet transform domain, describe
the underlying computational foundations of all
these algorithms and their implementation
techniques, and show the impact of these
algorithms in terms of image quality metrics and
computational requirements for implementation.

Subject: source of a half-remembered quotation?

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 444 (444)

I would be enormously grateful to anyone here for exact citation to
the author and work in which, I recall, a particularly
bizarre sorting of objects and phenomena is set out. I think the
author is the Taoist Chinese philosopher, Chuang-tzu (Zhuangzi), whom
I would have been reading in the Burton Watson translation. This
translation is now available in its entirely at
<a href="http://www.terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu.html">http://www.terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu.html</a>, but unfortunately I
cannot remember exact words, and so the usual sort of searching has
proven ineffective. The passage is a long list of things that are
grouped together but which we would ordinarily not associate. I take
it to be a Taoist lesson in the arbitrariness of all taxonomies. Very
Pythonesque, actually.
Many thanks for any leads.
Yours,
WM

Digital Projects Poster Session (11/25/07; SHARP 6/24/08-6/28/08)
CALL FOR POSTERS
Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing
International Conference
Hosted by the Oxford International Centre for Publishing Studies
(<a href="http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/conference/sharp2008/">http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/conference/sharp2008/</a>)
Oxford, England
June 24 - June 26, 2008
This year's conference theme, Teaching and the Text, is an
appropriate opportunity to highlight SHARP's commitment to digital
humanities projects, tools or techniques or work in progress. The
session also encourages proposals from any college or university
digital humanities program, center or group to present a poster that
overviews their program. Posters may include a demonstration,
traditional printed poster or a combination of both.
A brief bio and short abstracts (250-300 words) should be submitted
to Katherine D. Harris (kharris_at_email.sjsu.edu) before November 25,
2007. Please include any technical requirements (e.g., Internet
access). This panel will undergo the normal review procedure by the
SHARP conference committee. One participant for each proposal must be
a member of SHARP prior to the conference.
Founded in 1991, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading
and Publishing is a global network of literary scholars, historians,
librarians, booksellers, and publishing professionals. With more than
1,000 members in over 20 countries, SHARP works in concert with a
number of affiliated scholarly organizations around the world to
encourage the study of book history.
The conference theme, Teaching and Text, reflects the historical and
contemporary position of Oxford as a seat of learning and a centre of
academic and professional publishing. It will be developed through an
opening plenary lecture by Professor Juliet Gardiner (author of
Wartime Britain 1939-1945), by a panel on the History of Oxford
University Press led by Professor Simon Eliot (Chair in the History
of the Book at the School of Advanced Studies, University of London),
and a final plenary panel chaired by Professor John Barnard (Emeritus
Professor of English Literature, University of Leeds), and featuring
as panellists Dr. David McKitterick (Librarian and Fellow, Trinity
College, Cambridge); Dr. Peter McDonald (Rank Fellow and University
Lecturer in English Language and Literature, St Hugh's College,
Oxford); Dr. Sydney Shep (Senior Lecturer in Print & Book Culture and
The Printer, Wai-te-ata Press, Victoria University of Wellington);
and Professor Kathryn Sutherland (Professor of Bibliography and
Textual Criticism, St Anne's College, Oxford). Further plenary
sessions will be announced later. The AGM will be hosted by Oxford
University Press, and followed by a reception. Additional social
events will include a banquet at Magdalen College and receptions at
Blackwells Bookshop and the Bodleian Library.

Subject: Borges not Chuang-tzu
Date: Sat, 27 Oct 2007 10:27:20 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 447 (447)

My thanks to the 11 members of this group who 
answered my dazed query for the source of a 
quotation I could not remember, about a 
subversively bizarre way of sorting the world. My 
thanks specifically, in no particular order, to 
Hope Greenberg, Timothy Mason, Gray 
Kochhar-Lindgren, Jean-Franois Valle, Peter 
Boot, Philip Hanson, Clai Rice, John Unsworth, 
Christian Wittern, Marcus Bingenheimer and Wayne 
Hanewicz. The source is, of course, Jorge Luis 
Borges' story,  "The Analytical Language of John 
Wilkins" ("El idioma analtico de John Wilkins"),
to which Michel Foucault attributes the 
shattering laughter that broke up "all the 
familiar landmarks of my thought -- our 
thought... with which we are accustomed to tame 
the wild profusion of existing things" and so 
began the rethinking that resulted in his book 
Les Mots et les choses (1966, trans. The Order of 
Things, 1970). A couple of people pointed me to 
the Wikipedia entry dedicated to Borges' imagined 
Chinese encyclopedia, the Celestial Emportium of 
Benevolent Knowledge 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Recognition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Recognition</a>), 
where it is written that,
[deleted quotation]But I was saved from the inevitable temptation to 
medicalize my faulty remembering by another 
couple of people who likewise had thought 
Chuang-tzu was the source. Ah, if only we who 
favoured Chuang-tzu had not spent all that time 
reading Chinese philosophy! Indeed, Marcus 
Bingenheimer (Director, Library and Information 
Center, Dharma Drum Buddhist College, Taiwan), went on to comment that,
[deleted quotation]Nor are the passages describing metamorphosis in the Chuang-tzu, e.g.
[deleted quotation]This is serious play!
John Unsworth pointed out to me that Michael 
Sperberg-McQueen quoted the very passage from 
Borges in his learned chapter in the Blackwell's 
Companion to Digital Humanities, "Classification 
and its Structures" 
(<a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/">http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/</a>), where he says,
[deleted quotation]It all depends, I suppose, on what you're after. 
For me it comes down to the choice of the residue 
over the well-crafted scheme that isolates it. 
Recently I found myself sitting in yet another 
kitchen in a visiting researchers' residence in 
Leiden, where a theoretical linguist, having 
heard me go on about my beloved residue and my 
disrespect of rules, asked pointedly, "If the 
residue is so interesting, why isn't the rule 
that produced it?" A good question, I think.
Comments?

Subject: a room too small
Date: Mon, 29 Oct 2007 08:55:09 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 448 (448)

Let me pose an approach to a typical sort of literary problem and ask
for your comments. This approach I believe to be flawed, but I'd like
help in describing exactly how it is flawed.
The starting point is Ovid's Metamorphoses 1.2-3, specifically
"coeptis...meis" -- in this context:
[deleted quotation]Now one could argue, taking a Bakhtinian approach, that this literal
conspiracy between the gods and the poet is in effect a statement of
co-creative reading, a kind of license granted such a critic by the
poet. Be that as it may, the important matter here is not a
particular theory of how reading happens. Two things are important:
(1) not the enactment of any particular theory but the engagement
itself between the reader's idea of reading, whether consciously held
or implicit, and the poets text; (2) the way(s) in which the text
(en)trains the reader. What is demanded, then, is at the outset only
attentiveness to the words (ability to read them, i.e. mastery of the
language, is assumed). That is the single required act. Everything
else is optional, however desirable, e.g. knowledge of other Latin
literature, such as the Aeneid.
The ideal reader is as the one for whom Joyce writes Finnegans
Wake,  who knows all literature, is totally awake, never needs sleep.
The presumption here is that the uneducated reading and the educated
reading differ in nurture rather than by nature, that somehow with
the right amount of nurture (e.g. a classical education) things will
happen in the reading that may be utterly surprising but are
derivable from the text -- not the particular things that happen,
perhaps, but the capacity for them to happen. Or by analogy: when the
well nurtured plant flowers, all the lesser gardners are amazed, but
the flowering plant is the same genetically as the one that has never
flowered. Indeed, I suppose all this gets us straight into the arms
of the nature/nurture argument, for which see Ian Hacking's recent
review of G.E.R. Lloyd's Cognitive Variations (Oxford), "How shall we
repaint the kitchen?", London Review of Books, 1 November, pp. 17-19.
Why ask this question here? The temptation to think in terms of a
genetic code is *very* hard to resist for those of us computing
humanists who want to get beyond text information retrieval. The
dream that seems very easy to have is the ability to describe for a
text the process that all readers follow to a greater or lesser
degree, at all times and places. But this dream induces in me severe
cognitive claustrophia. Is there a doctor in the house?
Yours,
WM

Subject: stalled engine coughing back to life
Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2007 07:08:04 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 449 (449)

Dear colleagues,
My apologies for the rather lurching rhythm of Humanist these days. A
hard-disc crash put one of its mechanisms out of service for a time,
with a bit of a mess resulting, and of course delays in getting
messages out to you. Now things seem back to normal. One day, I hope
soon, we'll be getting a shiny new engine, which I trust will mean no
visible changes for you other than a more reliable delivery of the
messages. And then I can enjoy the luxury of being nostalgic about
the years when the whole thing was a hodge-podge of home-made parts.
(Indeed, a major part of the machinery of Humanist was made right
here, in this room, by a kind visitor in exchange for a place to stay.)
There is an television advert here made by some high-tech company
that deliberately harkens back to the days when radio and television
technology barely worked, with much hum and static, and those who
appeared or only spoke were barely trained. You'll see a placard held
unsteadily in front of the camera by someone's hand while the audio
hums away because it's not been properly earthed/grounded, and there
will be much "snow", as I recall it was called. The net-effect is
supposed to be charming, I guess, down-home, unthreatening etc. I
find it intensely annoying, silly, stupid etc. But it does serve as a
reminder of how far electronic engineering has brought us. Sharp,
clear images are so much a matter of course that we forget how much
work and ingenuity was required to make it so. But it's not just that
we've lost awareness of what's happening behind the scenes. I'm told
that I am not the only one who feels mentally deranged when one of my
computers does not work. It's almost as if my mind has extended
itself to assimilate the computer, making the machine part of itself,
and so a breakdown in the latter seem a breakdown in the former. I
suppose this is a contemporary version of the well-known
blindman-and-his-stick metaphor used by the phenomenologists.
Fortunately for my mental state, there must be a sort of
inverse-square law for computing, so that the failure of physically
very distant systems does not affect me as much as failures here.
When parts of Humanist break, I just feel isolated and, I admit,
enjoy the bit of silence while it lasts. Shocking! But thanks to
Shayne Brandon, the old engine at Virginia has sputtered into life
again, so once again I make my morning rounds.
Yours,
WM

Subject: the Pigeonhole Problem
Date: Tue, 30 Oct 2007 07:10:07 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 451 (451)

Yesterday I spent a delightful and enlightening time talking to an IT
instructor and an historian in a local public school about
establishing a relationship between this school and my department.
The IT instructor confirmed my sense that students in the UK system
(which streams its students rather narrowly) tend simply to go from
their major subject in school straight into the corresponding
department in university. They choose what they know, and they know
what to choose by the familiar label which each subject carries. So,
he pointed out, the digital humanities needs a pigeonhole, and the
pigeonhole requires its tag. The historian asked me to tell him what
"digital humanities" signifies in at most two sentences. I came up
with one: "It trains students to think with and against the
computer". What would be your sentence?
The problem with our kind, or with my kind of our kind, is our love
for complexity, for difficulty, for problems challenging enough to
give us the cognitive exercise we crave. As David Hilbert said in his
famous lecture of 1900, we need problems "difficult in order to
entice us, yet not completely inaccessible, lest it mock at our
efforts". But he also quoted some "old French mathematician": "A
mathematical theory is not to be considered complete until you have
made it so clear that you can explain it to the first man whom you
meet on the street." The latter is the real challenge. Indeed, I'd
say that you can't rest until you can explain the subject you teach,
and/or in which you do your research, to schoolboys and girls. Name
that pigeonhole!
The lamentable fact is not that students need it but that our
colleagues do also, and many of them lost their curiosity many years
ago. The blinkering effect of disciplinary training is a hard lesson
to learn. But perhaps if we get our pigeonhole appealingly labelled,
the path which students beat to our door will lead blinkered
colleagues from what they can see to what they cannot.
Name that pigeonhole!
Yours,
WM

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 454 (454)

Willard,
allow me to counter your gardening analogy with a real-life story. The
(Eastern European, non-EU member) university where I am employed decided
to switch to digital, centralized accounting of all things
student-related. But my part of this university -- the Faculty of
Humanities and Social Sciences -- has this system where you can study two
main programmes (e. g. Latin and Comparative Literature) in parallel --
*any* two of more than thirty the Faculty is currently offering.  At the
same time, the study programmes have undergone a thorough revision (to be
transformed in accordance with the Bologna process).
Theoretically speaking, digital administration of an institution is a
banal, almost trivial task. You define a set of rules and apply these
rules to data in the databases.
Practically -- it has proven quite a challenge.  In fact, we are in the
middle of a chaos now, where more than 50% of my first-year students have
some error in their administrative records, with very little means of
getting these errors fixed (apart from the old, not-by-defined-rule,
manual way).
I want to say that yes, basically, or theoretically, the wonderful plant
is a product of the same (sort of) seed from which less-than-wonderful
plants are nurtured -- but the actual number of variables, of unknown
factors, and their interactions, and *skills* required for nurturing, all
of this very soon exceeds the actual power of... computing, or
imagination.
We may *imagine* that an uninformed reading is basically the same as a
perfect reading, but, to imagine it, we have to leave out very, very much.
Yours,
Neven

While working well outside the profession, (though in the commercial
peripheries of such tasks i.e. marketing research) --
I've always thought of digital humanities as being something like:
"The synthesis of natural and artificial intelligence for the purposes of
mining and modeling the archives of human thought".
This of course is broad enough to mean whatever you want it to mean, but
certaintly sounds more attractive then "using computers to crunch subjective
data".

Dear Willard,
I think a cage rather than a pigeonhole is needed to address this problem.
The label, Digital Humanities, is a dinosaur. It was introduced by those who
remember how research was conducted in the pre-digital era. The dinosaur
needs to return where it belongs. I'm not surprised the label is meaningless
to most students. Equally meaningless are titles such as 'New Media Readers'
by MIT etc. that include pre-Turing authors. Once we realise the dinosaur is
extinct, we may happily return to the healthy old-fashioned subject
taxonomies, and start afresh with the HUMANITIES (rather than Digital
Humanities), ART HISTORY (rather than Digital Art History), etc.

Willard,
Although I am no longer deeply involved in humanities computing, I am
almost daily involved in using my computer to assist me in my studies
and teaching of Civil Liberties.  Here is my "pigeonhole" sentence:
Humanities computing trains students to use the power of computing to
enable inquiries in the humanities that by hand and brain alone would
be too difficult or time-consuming to be feasible, thus opening major
new vistas on our disciplines and ourselves.

[deleted quotation]Two sentences?
1. When you want to browse for a book, isn't Amazon much better than a
paper-based card catalog?
2. Now imagine having other tools, as powerful as Amazon, that help us
with actually *using* the book; reading, interpreting, and
understanding it.
That's a rough draft.  I think such exercises in crafting an elevator
pitch are very important.
By the way, this challenge reminds me of a question that's popular in
job interviews at Google.  "Explain a database in three sentences to
your eight-year-old nephew."  If you put that phrase into Google, you
will find suggested answers from many people. For example: "A database
is a way of organizing information. It's like a genie who knows where
every toy in your room is. Instead of hunting for certain toys
yourself and searching the whole room, you can ask the genie to find
all your toy soldiers, or only X-Men action figures, or only race cars
-- anything you want."

Dear Willard,
I intersected Bentkowska's and Tannenbaum's suggestions:
"Humanities should a.o. train students to use the power of computing to
enable inquiries that by hand and brain alone would
be too difficult or time-consuming to be feasible, thus opening major
new vistas on our disciplines and ourselves."
That makes perfect sense to me.

Service-Oriented Computing in the Humanities (SOCH)
Call for Participation: Second Workshop on Service-Oriented Computing in the
Humanities (SOCH)
Service-Oriented Computing in the Humanities (SOCH)
A joint workshop of the EPSRC Service-Oriented Software Research
Network (SOSoRNet) and the AHRC ICT Methods Network
King's College London, UK, 17-18 December 2007
A key message to emerge from the first SOCH workshop, held at King's
one year ago, is that communities of practice in the humanities are
increasingly turning to service-oriented approaches as their data
becomes ever more complex and dispersed. This second event will seek
to provide those researchers a forum for intensive discussion, framed
by a highly focused group of international speakers from the cutting
edge of service-oriented research as applied to the humanities (with
examples from music, archaeology and medieval history); as well as
from academics working with tools and resources that have the
potential to develop new research methodologies based around the
service-oriented approach.
The programme of invited speakers will include:
- David de Roure, University of Southampton
- mc schraefel, University of Southampton
- Michael Meredith, University of Sheffield
- Stuart Jeffrey, Archaeology Data Service
- Xavier Llora, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
- J. Stephen Downie, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
We now invite participation in this workshop. It is likely to be of
interest to any humanist researcher working with, or interested in,
advanced network technologies, as well as to computer scientists who
are interested in learning more about this new and rapidly developing
area of application. Participation is free and open to all, but
registration is essential as numbers may be limited.
To register, please complete the registration form on the sosornet

CLEARING UP COPYRIGHT CONFUSION
"The fundamental goals of media literacy education--to cultivate
critical thinking about media and its role in culture and society and
to strengthen creative communication skills--are compromised by
unnecessary copyright restrictions and lack of understanding about
copyright law, as interviews with dozens of teachers and makers of
media literacy curriculum materials showed. . . . [As a result,]
teachers use less effective teaching techniques, teach and transmit
erroneous copyright information, fail to share innovative instructional
approaches, and do not take advantage of new digital platforms."
In "The Cost of Copyright Confusion for Media Literacy," the report's
investigators argue that, much as documentary film makers have done,
"media literacy educators from K-12 to university level can articulate
their own shared understandings of appropriate fair use in a code of
practice." Such a code could provide guidance for educators and clear
up misconceptions that hinder the legitimate use of copyrighted works.

Center for Social Media, in partnership with the Washington College of
Law's Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property and the

STATISTICS ON THE STATE OF EDUCATION, U.S. AND WORLDWIDE
The Sloan Consortium's "Online Nation: Five Years of Growth in Online
Learning," a report on the state of online learning in U.S. higher
education, is "aimed at answering some of the fundamental questions
about the nature and extent of online education." These questions
include:
-- How many students are learning online?
-- Where has the growth in online learning occurred?
-- What are the prospects for future online enrollment growth?
-- What are the barriers to widespread adoption of online education?
The report, and previous years' editions, can be downloaded at no cost

TECHNE: James Joyce, Hypertext & Technology
by Louis Armand
2nd corrected edition, with index
ISBN 978-80-246-1382-6 (paperback). 234pp.
October 2007
Publisher: Karolinum/Charles University Press

Price: euros 12.00 (not including postage)
While this study is concerned with the question 
of technology in its relation to the work of 
James Joyce and theories of hypertext, it is 
also, and more specifically, addressed to a 
concept of technology arising from the language 
of Finnegans Wake. Drawing upon developments in 
communication theory and information technology, 
this study attempts to map a parallel development 
in Joyce's uses of language in the Wake, arguing 
that Joyce's writing provides a model for 
re-thinking the relationship between technology 
and "all forms of cultural production." The 
purpose of this is not, however, to suggest that 
Joyce was necessarily in some way cognisant of a 
future possibility of hypertext, nor is it simply 
concerned with a retrospective glance at Joyce 
from the position of current computing 
technologies. Rather, it is to examine how 
Joyce's work is aware of its own position against 
and within contemporary developments in the 
sciences and electronic media, and that Joyce 
incorporated material from these developments into his texts.
"Techne is an elaborate and passionate mapping of 
the ways in which hypertext is, in fact, like 
Joyce. In this respect it will be an essential 
benchmark in Joyce scholarship, as seminal as the 
work of Hugh Kenner in the 1950s and 1960s, which 
also set the style and tone for a generation of Joyce criticism."
--Darren Tofts, author of Memory Trades
"The main purposes of Armand's important study 
are primarily to 'trace the historical 
development of communications technologies in the 
context of Joyce's writing,' while secondarily 
examining their effects on Joyce scholarship ... 
throughout the book he presents an important new 
understanding of the relationship of Joyce's work 
to the evolution of hypertext from mechanization 
and the new electric media ... I strongly 
recommend this book for its rigorous and 
illuminationg understanding of the importance of 
technology to Joyce and for the understanding of 
Joyce's affinities with major movements of the 
first half of the twentieth century."
--Donald Theall, James Joyce Quarterly

Studies programme in the Philosophy Faculty of

Solicitations: Essays on Criticism & Culture;

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 5, 2007
ACRL invites comment on scholarly communication research agenda
CHICAGO  A new report by the Association of College and Research
Libraries (ACRL) explores the gaps in our understanding of the ways that
scholars create and share new knowledge. The report lays out a
preliminary research agenda for creating greater understanding of the
rapidly evolving system of scholarly communication  the way  research
results and new knowledge are registered, evaluated for quality,
disseminated and preserved. Meaningful research about the system of
scholarly communication will inform strategic planning for scholarly
communication programs.
The white paper, "Establishing a Research Agenda for Scholarly
Communication: A Call for Community Engagement," encourages academics,
librarians and their key partners to gather more data on practices that
both enable and inhibit the production of scholarship and its
communication. The report identifies eight themes, with research
possibilities in each area.
The paper resulted from a one-day invitational meeting in July 2007, to
collectively brainstorm the evidence needed to manage and influence the
changing environment. Attendees included representatives from ACRL, the
Association of Research Libraries, the Council on Library and
Information Resources, the Coalition for Networked Information, Ithaka,
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and
Academic Resources Coalition). ACRL scholarly communication committee
co-chairs John Ober of the University of California and Joyce Ogburn of
the University of Utah convened the meeting and discuss the report at
<a href="http://blogs.ala.org/acrlpodcast.php">http://blogs.ala.org/acrlpodcast.php</a>.
The document is available online for public comment at
<a href="http://www.acrl.ala.org/scresearchagenda">http://www.acrl.ala.org/scresearchagenda</a>. Please submit comments
that:
--Refine or expand the need for research, important issues and
possible projects.
-- Identify additional articles and reports that collectively form a
knowledge base from which the research agenda emerges more clearly.
-- Suggest ways to conduct the research.
-- Volunteer to participate or collaborate in a specific research
initiative.
-- Propose additional avenues of distribution for the report.
Confidential comments may be emailed to John Ober at John.Ober_at_ucop.edu

DOCAM '08 is the fifth Annual meeting of the
Document Academy, an international network of
scholars, artists and professionals in various
fields interested in the exploration of the
document as a useful approach, concept and tool
in Sciences, Arts, Business, and Society.
The aim of The Document Academy is to create an
interdisciplinary space for experimental and
critical research on documents in a wide sense,
drawing on traditions and experiences around the
world. It originated as a co-sponsored effort by
The Program of Documentation Studies, University
of Tromso, Norway and the School of Information,
University of California, Berkeley. For 2008, the
University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Library
and Information Studies will be hosting the meeting.
The conference will run from 9 AM Friday, March
28, to 5 PM Saturday, March 29.  In order to keep
the open-ended discussion atmosphere of previous
DOCAMs alive along with a growing number of
participants, we have decided to have only
plenary sessions and a relatively limited, but
well-selected number of presentations.

Reconfiguring social	and urban networks via locative media
CALL FOR PAPERS
for Edited Book Hybrid Reality Games:
Reconfiguring social and urban networks via locative media
Edited by: Adriana de Souza e Silva, Ph.D.=20
(Communication, North Carolina State University) souzaesilva_at_ncsu.edu
Daniel Sutko (Communication, North Carolina State University)  dmsutko_at_ncsu.edu
Description: Games are pervasive activities in
human culture. The strong success of video and
computer games during the last 20 years can make
us forget that the physical environment has
always been the primary playful space. But if
computers helped take games to digital spaces,
the popularity of mobile technologies takes them
back to the physical. The pervasiveness of mobile
phones, which allow us to walk around urban
spaces connected to the Internet and each other,
encourages the creation of a new type of game
arena that takes place simultaneously in physical
and digital spaces. In these games,
communication, collaboration, and interaction
occur in a combination of the physical and the
digital=97in hybrid spaces. In such games the
players=92 mobility and position in space indeed matter.
Hybrid Reality and Location-based games transform
the players' perception of urban spaces, as well
as the intrinsic definition of game space. This
edited book invites essays that critically
investigate the inter-relations among mobile
technologies, location-based activities, and
playful / social spaces, with the ultimate goal
of finding interconnections between games and social networks.
Submitted essays should focus on three main areas:
(1) The history of games as social environments,
with particular emphasis on MUDs and RPGs, as
predecessors of hybrid reality/location-based
gaming. Essays in this part of the book are
encouraged to explore how game communities are
formed, how players in these types of games
contribute to the creation of the game space,
game content, and the social relationships inside and outside the game.
(2) Theoretical papers about location aware
games, differentiating these types of activities
from previous game theories on video games.
Besides theoretical papers, we also welcome case
studies on current location-based, hybrid reality
games, urban games, and pervasive games. In
summary, we look for defining an overarching
concept for the different types of multiuser
games that employ mobile technologies as interfaces.
(3) Essays that investigate games beyond the pure
entertainment approach, including articles that
explore uses of hybrid reality, location aware
and pervasive activities in educational contexts,
media arts, training, corporate environments, and
other similar activities. Essays might draw
connections among gaming, education, art, and other location-based=
  activities.
These are suggested research themes, but similar
topics will also be considered. The book will be
directed at academic readers, but should be
attractive to the gaming community and industry insiders, as well.
Abstracts of 500/700 words describing the
proposed papers are due by December 15th, 2007
with those accepted due in final form by June
15th, 2008. Submissions may be in the form of
empirical research studies or theory-building
papers and should be 5000/7000 words (in
English). Abstracts must include a brief biography of the author(s).
Proposals and inquiries should be sent
electronically to souzaesilva_at_ncsu.edu .
Deadlines: Paper abstracts: December 15th  2007(500/700 words)
Notification of accepted abstracts: January 15th  2008
Full papers: June 15th 2008 (5000/7000 words)

Subject: making digital resources more visible
Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2007 08:27:19 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 481 (481)

Dear Humanists,
We have seen an increasing amount of digital
resources and service being made available over
the last couple of years. Many of these resources
can make certain tasks a lot easier or enable
researchers to ask new questions or get better
answers to existing ones. However, researchers in
the Arts and Humanities are perhaps not as aware
of these resources as they could be.
To help people get started, JISC have recently
published a briefing paper highlighting its
services and projects particularly of interest to the A&H community:
<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/artshumanitiesresearchv1.aspx">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/artshumanitiesresearchv1.aspx</a>
This has prompted us, together with JISC, to
start a discussion about what could be done to
make Arts and Humanities researchers aware of the
breadth of helpful resources out there. This is a
chance for the community to discuss what kind of
support they need and to engage in a discussion
that might also inform the policy of funding bodies such as JISC.
Do you have relevant ideas, experiences or
suggestions -- even questions -- then make your voice heard at
<a href="http://www.arts-humanities.net/forum/how_can_we_raise_awareness_digital_resources">http://www.arts-humanities.net/forum/how_can_we_raise_awareness_digital_resources</a>

Feel free to forward this to anyone interested.
We would very much value your input!

I have no illusions that my pacifist views are going to prevail, none
at all.  But every great change in expanding the dimensions of human
freedom has come from very small original beginnings: somebody said
"no." -- Steve Cary (1916 - 2002)

In "Psychological Models for Guidance", Harvard Educational Review 32
(1962), Gordon W Allport begins by saying,
[deleted quotation]At the time the technology for correcting eyesight was rather
limited, so Allport can be excused for using a metaphor which makes
it seem as if a re-examination of our fundamental epistemic
assumptions is as simple as getting fitted for a new pair of glasses.
The grinding of lenses gives a hint of some difficulty, it is true,
but this happens well away from the person concerned. Now, of course,
we could speak of surgery to cut out the corneas of a person's eyes
and replace them with new, plastic ones. But until that becomes
commonplace, if it does, the metaphor has at least the advantage of
being frightening or at least off-putting.  And that hints at how
difficult it is for people of the sort we deal with to readjust their
thinking to understand what we're hopping up and down about.
In a local discussions during the last couple of days, the question
of what we think students get from studying our subject was raised --
the hopping-up-and-down question in another form. One context was the
questioning of external examiners, who in this instance came from
various disciplines to consider our postgraduate students'
performance and our assessment of it. The difficulty for them (none
of whom was from the digital humanities) was in part understanding
what sort of expectations we could possibly have of the students. A
more serious because more immediate and prior questioning then took
place amongst us. Apart from teaching certain practical skills, with
what sort of cognitive equipment can we say we are equipping them?
Increasingly, at least in the UK, one not only has to state the
"learning outcomes", one has to have some way of demonstrating that
these are at least occasionally realised.
If one reflects on the fact that MA-level training takes place, in a
full-time programme, over a single year, what can one hope to
accomplish? Given no prior exposure to the digital humanities (often
the case for postgraduates), what would you suppose to be reasonable
educational goals?
Yours,
WM

Call for Papers:
The Lives of the Book
Nancy-Universit, France
20-21 June 2008
Deadline for proposals: 21 January 2008
The goal of this conference is to provide a forum within which questions
relating to the production, distribution and reception of the book can be
explored from a variety of perspectives. Confirmed keynote speakers
include Tony Lacey (Publishing Director of Penguin Books), Barbara
Bordalejo (Director of the Institute for Textual Scholarship and
Electronic Editing, University of Birmingham) and Marie-Franoise Cachin
(Founder of the Society of the Book and Publishing (LEMA), Universit
Paris7).
Papers relating to the following areas of study are particularly
encouraged: 1) The historical evolution of the book: In what ways does a
consideration of the material changes that the book underwent over the
centuries provide more general insights into the evolution of Western
culture? 2) The status of the book in contemporary culture: How has the
book's status changed with the rise of electronic media? How do choices
relating to the book&#x2019;s material production affect the ways in which texts
are interpreted? 3) The book and the text: How do we theorise the division
between book and text today? In practical terms, what are the consequences
of separating the text from the book, for example in the preparation of an
electronic edition or an electronic archive?
Other possible subjects include: the politics of book preservation in
public and private archives and collections, and the manner in which such
archives are exploited; the illustration and ornamentation of books; re-
printings and new editions; comparative studies of different book markets
(England/U.S.; English-speaking/foreign, etc.) or audiences (&#x2018;scholarly&#x2019;
books, children&#x2019;s books, audio books, books in Braille, etc).
Proposals (title and an abstract of about 300 words) should be sent by e-
mail to David Ten Eyck (david.ten-eyck_at_univ-nancy2.fr) and Nathalie Coll-
Bak (nathalie.colle_at_univ-nancy2.fr).

Hi Willard,
I think we can't reasonably hope for more than is possible in any
other one-year (or in our case at University of Alberta two-year) MA
programme. I want the students to be able to show that:
- they have had exposure to at least some of the literature in the
digital humanities generally, and to more in their own research area
- they have developed some awareness of the ongoing discussions and
where we as a community are at with them
- that they know something about the range of research methods or
research approaches in use by digital humanists
- that they have tried out some of these methods for themselves in
the context of a real research project and not just as a classroom
exercise. One way, and I think a good way, to accomplish this is to
have real projects as the exercises.
- that they have had practice communicating their ideas, preferably
at various lengths, in different genres, and in different media
yrs,

I would like to invite you all to check out the updated version of
the Dictionary of Words in the Wild:
<a href="http://tapor1-dev.mcmaster.ca/~dictwordwild/">http://tapor1-dev.mcmaster.ca/~dictwordwild/</a>
For those who haven't come across it, the Dictionary is a social
image site where users can upload images of public (wild) textuality
which can then be accessed through a dictionary interface, search, or
API. Thanks to participants like Willard McCarty we now have over
3000 unique words in over 2000 images.
We now have some new features:
1. Registered users can comment on the images of words uploaded.
2. For those who are interested we have a statistics page where you
can generate statistics.
I encourage all of you with digital cameras and an interest in the
words around you to participate.
Yours,

Subject: European Reference Index for the Humanities
Date: Sat, 17 Nov 2007 09:14:28 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 495 (495)

Dear all,
Some time ago, the European Science Foundation (ESF) published its
European Reference Index for the Humanities [1]:
The use of this list is defined as follows;
'The ERIH lists will help to identify excellence in Humanities
scholarship and should prove useful for the aggregate benchmarking of
national research systems, for example, in determining the
international standing of the research activity carried out in a
given field in a particular country. However, as they stand, the
lists are not a bibliometric tool. The ERIH Steering Committee and
the Expert Panels therefore advise against using the lists as the
only basis for assessment of individual candidates for positions or
promotions or of applicants for research grants.'
However, we all know, and it is admitted informally by members of the
reviewing panel, that the list will be considered a major reference
tool for bibliometric purposes in research assessment, especially
because the three humanities computing journals (LLC, Chum, Text
Technology) don't appear in the ISI web of knowledge [2] which is the
standard bibliometric tool in research assesment in Belgium, for instance.
The journals:
- Literary and Linguistic Computing
- Computers and the Humanities
- Text Technology
Appear in the list of the Linguistics journals [3] (there is no list
for literature journals) and they are all identified with a 'B'
label. This means, according to the Guidelines [4] :
"standard international publications with a good reputation among
researchers of the field in different countries."
A-label journals, however, are considered to be:
"high-ranking international publications with a very strong
reputation among researchers of the field in different countries,
regularly cited all over the world."
Although "Humanities Computing" is recognized as a research area in
the Humanities by the ESF [5], these journals are assessed from the
perspective of the discipline of linguistics only, which defines 'the
field'. From this perspective, the assesment is probably right. If,
however, Humanities Computing would have been considered a discipline
in its own right, the journals would no doubt have received an 'A'
status for the simple reason that they are the high-ranking
international publications with a good reputation among researchers
of Humanities Computing in different countries. This shows once more
the political and societal (and economical) need for a disciplinary
debate and definition as prodded by, a.o., Willard McCarty and myself
over the last couple of years.
Procedures for feedback to the ERIH initial list 'to enable
researchers and publishers to provide input for consideration at the
first update (in 2008)' have been released.[6]
If we consider our journals to be worthy of an A-label, and if we
want to include other peer-reviewed publications in our field such as
DHQ and HumanIT, to name just these two, I think there is an
opportunity to take action in the feedback procedure.
Matter for discussion?
Edward

Subject: XML document management systems
Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2007 07:06:08 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 499 (499)

Dear colleagues,
For those of your working collaboratively with XML documents, what
systems do you use to manage your work?
The Orlando project built its own system years ago to support the
collaborative writing and editing of its documents. It archives,
provides version control, tracks workflow according to the
responsibility tags within the documents, allows communications
between team members about particular documents, enables various
reports to be generated, provides access to project documentation,
etc., but most of these things are discrete tasks.  We need before
long to rebuild the system and are interested in developing a new
environment that would integrate some of the key activities more
effectively to simply our workflow processes.
Has anyone developed anything along these lines, or do you know of
off-the-shelf/open source systems that do any of these various things?
Many thanks,
Susan

Subject: Open Conference Systems/Open Journal Systems
Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2007 07:06:49 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 500 (500)

Dear Colleagues,
Another question: has anyone used the Public Knowledge Project's Open
Conference Systems to publish conference proceedings online?
If so, how well did the system support collaborative editing and
communication among authors and editors?
Does the system support XML? A quick scan of their introductory
documentation suggests that it does not, apart from allowing
abstracts to be exported in NLM Meeting Abstracts XML format.
I'd also be interested in knowing what kind of experience people have
had, if any, using the PKP's Open Journal System for publications
other than journals, and whether the system supports XML publication
beyond the possibility to export metadata in particular XML formats.
Had anyone used the Erudit plug-in for OJS, and if so, how well does
it support XML and the collaborative production/editing of texts?
Many thanks,
Susan

Greetings.
Susan Brown said:
[deleted quotation]I don't know of any systems which work specifically with XML
documents, but the requirements you have are probably almost
completely compatible with those of a general software development
support system -- the phrase to google is 'issue tracking' software.
There are a number of those available.  Sourceforge is one of the
best known, but there are a number listed at
<<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a>
wiki/Comparison_of_Free_Software_Hosting_Facilities>.  Those are
hosting services rather than examples of hosting software, but if for
some reason you have a need to have the software running on your own
machines, several of them make their software available for that
purpose (the <<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourceforge">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourceforge</a>> article
refers in particular to Savane and GForge as free projects).  There
are plenty more systems than are listed here.
Based on my own experience, I can say that Sourceforge (the service,
and thus implicitly the software) is perfectly functional but feels a
little clunky, and Google Code has been functional to the limited
extent I've used it so far, and as smooth as Google things usually are.
The other system I know of is Bugzilla (functional, but still
clunky).  Jira <<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a>> is used by
Apache, so it manifestly scales well.
Good luck,

---> Design: Management: Organization <---
---> Call for Papers to the 4th Art of Management Conference <---
The fourth Art of Management Conference meets
from September 9 to 12 at the Banff Center in Banff, Alberta, Canada.
<a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/AFM/emc/fourth_art_of_management_and_org.shtm">http://www.essex.ac.uk/AFM/emc/fourth_art_of_management_and_org.shtm</a>
This call invites papers and presentations for the stream on
Design: Management: Organization
The potential of design in management and
organizations is now the focus of a growing body
of knowledge in practice and theory. Theoretical
results appear in books and journal articles,
education programs, and research projects, while
businesses of all kinds put the findings into
practice, along with design firms, consulting firms, and universities.
Design is a practice of making. We realize design
in many ways: as artefact, system, and
experience. The complexity and seemingly endless
potential of design is visible in fascinating and continuously evolving=
  ways.
In this stream, we ask what design thinking can
mean, examining how we can interpret and enact
design thinking in thought, artifact, experience, and action.
We invite contributions to this stream from
practitioners and scholars who explore the
intersection of design, management, and
organization. We are particularly interested in
discovering how people engage design in
management and organizational contexts. We
welcome case study accounts from designers,
design managers, general managers, and scholars
in design theory and organization theory. We also
welcome theoretical and conceptual presentations.
Many questions will interest participants in this
stream: Why is design important to the future of
management and organizational contexts? Can
design help us to save organizations? How do
design organizations enact design within their
own management and organizational contexts? What
is design management? Is there a space for poetic
design in managerial and organizational contexts?
We hope to explore design as creative practice,
design as critical thinking, design as systems management, and design as =8A
The conveners of the stream hope to develop the
presentations from this stream into a special journal issue.
For papers, please submit abstracts of 500 words.
For other presentations, we will accept any appropriate media submission.
Please send submissions to
Dr. Laurene Vaughan at
<laurene.vaughan_at_rmit.edu.au>
with a copy to

I'd be most grateful for attribution of a remark by a theoretical
physicist, who when asked about the implementation of his work said
disparagingly something like, "all the rest is merely engineering".
Was it Werner Heisenberg?
I'd also be interested in collecting other such remarks directed
against practical work, to the effect that it is merely the
application of knowledge gained through "pure" reasoning.
Many thanks.

Sanjay Kumar Pal writes:  "Designing and building
complex products to exact customer specifications
frequently involves long lead times and heavy
engineering content. To win business, you must
provide accurate estimates and quotations to a
demanding customer base. Unlike the majority of
manufacturers, capital equipment manufacturers
typically purchase material to a specific project
or job. You need to do progress billing and
collect actual costs to projects. Often, you will
not receive payment for a project until it is
installed and operating at a customer=B9s site. So,
cash management is of vital importance. And after
the sale, you need to track warranty information

Willard,
1. the Net attributes the phrase to Feynman: "maybe Feynman would have
agreed with me on that, since he even said that what was going on on the
Manhattan project was merely engineering."

2. There is an application of the saying to biology:
Perhaps it might be said that molecular biology has no use for theory, and
biology is now merely engineering in the sense that it takes things apart
to see how they work? The possibility that biology is in the predicament
of having lost its status as a speculative science is proposed by Shostak
in Death of Life, and presumably he would like to correct this state of
affairs.

3. a nice one on digital archiving:
Only one fundamental problem impeded digital archiving until
recently -- how to preserve information through technology changes.
This was recently solved, but the correctness and practicality of the
solution are still to be demonstrated.  The other challenges are merely
engineering and solution deployment issues.

4. another on building a wiki:
Are you saying methods of building a successful wiki are so well known
that it's not science, it's merely engineering and technology to set up a
wiki properly and, if you follow the rules, it is guaranteed to work?

5. one on classification research:
Obviously we have not solved all the classification problem in the world
-- new applications bring new challenges, many of which are still
beyond reach. But do these require fundamental breakthroughs in
classification research? Or are these "merely engineering
problems" that will eventually be solved with more machine power, or
more likely, more human power to find better feature extractors and fine
tune the classifier parameters?
Source:

6. a different take on the figure ("not just, though..."):
Macroscopic classical electrodynamics is practically useful. Not just
merely engineering (though used to torment many an EE student in their
most difficult of courses), since it's essential to many fields of
applied physics. OK, it's an engineering approach, but so what? You teach
A and B, either in a separate QED course, or as decorative fluff in an EM
course, before you get to the gritty details of actually solving the
Maxwell equations (EDHB), and the Laplace, Poisson, vector Helmholtz, and
scalar paraxial wave equations.

--- Of course, anybody interested can google for themselves, just as I
did.  But I like what vox populi out there says -- in the usage there
seems to be another opposition present: not only engineering versus
science, but also engineering versus culture / society (not that it is
useful to you, I know).  Also, people seem to be using the phrase more in
a negative, or interrogative way -- "is it really...", or "it is not..."

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 522 (522)

Neven's transcription of the vox populi on the phrase "merely
engineering" is more useful to me than he supposed, though
my query was confined to the dismissive attitude of scientific
theorists. Like common uses of similar phrases, such as "merely
mechanical", the put-down of engineering suggests the old
aristocratic prejudice against those who work with their hands, or
more radically, those who *do* anything at all in a serious way, have
a job, work etc. I enlisted the aid of people here because I was
ruminating once again for purposes of an ongoing essay on the
distinction between "pure" and "applied" research, specifically
unpicking the prejudices packed into the supposed purity of research
that is motivated by curiosity rather than by the requirement for
deliverables. There seems to be a cry for freedom in that opposition
which I would not want to get lost by getting confused with
repugnance for the physical and with ignorance of epistemic practices
aimed at "thing knowledge".
In a recent conference paper, Martha Nussbaum adopted the primatologist
Frans van der Waal's term "anthropodenial" (by which he means our
denial that we are animals of a certain kind) to explain much human
cruelty and misery. She went more than a little bit over the top with
her thesis (which involved an astonishing idealization of non-human
animal life), but there does seem to be something in the need to separate
or at least adjust the balance between body-life and mind-life. In his recent
review of Geoffrey Lloyd's book Cognitive Variations (2007), which steers
a course through various topics, considering the opposition between
nature and nurture (or culture, as Lloyd prefers), Ian Hacking concludes
at the very end, "If, despire all the differences of detail, we go on asking
the same questions in each domain, is there not something suspect about
the way we have carved them up?" So let me ask: how better might we
talk about the research we do (and that we avoid doing) than always to
be rattling on about pure vs applied, or curiosity-motivated vs mission-
orientated or whatever?

Subject: launch of U of Maryland's Digital Repository
Date: Thu, 29 Nov 2007 06:17:32 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 525 (525)

The University of Maryland Libraries is delighted to announce the
launch of its digital collections portal at <<a href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/">http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/</a> >
This release marks two and a half years of work in the creation of a
repository that serves the teaching and research mission of the
University of Maryland Libraries. Many of the objects are digital
versions from Maryland's Special Collections (such as A Treasury of
World's Fairs Art and Architecture) or are new virtual collections
(The Jim Henson Works). Other collections (such as Films_at_UM) support
the teaching mission of the Libraries. This release also marks the
integration of electronically available finding aids, ArchivesUM,
into the repository architecture, creating a framework for digital
objects to be dynamically discovered from finding aids.
The repository is based on the Fedora platform, uses Lucene for
indexing, and Helix for streaming video. The repository features
almost 2500 digital objects, with new objects added monthly. Object
types currently delivered include full text (both TEI and EAD),
video, and images. Objects can be discovered within a collection
context or via a search across multiple collections. Cross-collection
discovery is achieved through a common metadata scheme and controlled
vocabulary. This metadata scheme also provides for individual
collections to have more granular domain-specific metadata.
We welcome feedback and comments at <a href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/contact.jsp">http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/contact.jsp</a>
With all best wishes,
Susan Schreibman

A New Trivium and Quadrivium
George Bugliarello
Polytechnic University
Today's conflicts between the views that the
humanities hold of science and engineering and the views science
and engineering hold of the humanities weaken the
very core of our culture. Their cause is lack of integration
in today's education among subjects that hark
back to the medieval trivium and quadrivium. A
new trivium is needed to provide every educated
person with a basic understanding of the
endeavors and instruments that help us address
our world and shape a new morality -- the
humanities, in the noblest sense of the word, to
civilize, science to understand nature, and
engineering, broadly defined, to encompass the
kindred activities that modify nature.
Integration of these endeavors is urgent. It
involves, in turn, an intimate interaction (the
"biosoma") of biological organisms, society, and
machines -- a new quadrivium. No domain can any
longer be considered and learned in isolation.

- to support students with information and advice on academic,
    research and industrial careers;
The Doctoral Consortium is a student mentoring program that introduces
students to senior researchers with similar interests. Students
accepted into the Doctoral Consortium are waived registration fee for
KR2008 and present their work during a poster session. They can
apply for a scholarship that partly covers their travel expenses.
We encourage submissions from PhD students at any level, and from any
topic area within Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Applications
must be submitted via our online submission site (see below).
Each application must contain the following materials:
- Thesis summary. A description of the problem being addressed, the
    motivation for addressing the problem, proposed plan of research, the
    progress to date (what you have already achieved and what remains to
    be done), and related work. It must be four pages maximum in the usual
    KR double-column style.
- Letter of recommendation. A letter from your thesis advisor that states
    that (s)he supports your participation in the DC.

Date: Sun, 02 Dec 2007 09:03:09 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 530 (530)

I have a different take on this quote. It isn't as disparaging as you seem to
imply. The contrast is between "undiscovered scientific principles" and
"execution of known techniques". If, for example, we are faced with closing a
hole in the Ozone layer, or having a spacecraft survive a landing on Venus to
radio back information from the surface, or finding a means to neutralize
radioactivity, (or from the past, seeing aircraft in the night sky far away
from land (i.e., radar), then the first task it to understand enough of how the
universe works to have a plausible theory of what can be done to perform such a
task. Once a "theory" exists, then it is "merely a matter of engineering" to
build and test a device to perform the task.
Now, admittedly, we have had remarkable inventions (e.g., electric light) that
resulted JUST from engineering methods. Edison had next to no "theory" of what
he needed in a filament for electric light bulbs. He tested everything he could
think of. This was a breakthrough by "merely engineering". So, I
guess one could say theorists disparage such an approach unreasonably
because there is no way toprove a theoretical insight couldn't reach a
satisfactory solution.
I guess it comes down to a belief in the existence of theoretical knowledge as
adequate to find an answer. Perhaps this is what plagues "String Theory" in
Physics. There is so much theoretical knowledge that practitioners cannot
believe that they can't reach a theoretical solution--and persist even when
there is almost no testable experimentation that can be used to validate one
theory vs. another. The physicists believe in a sense of beauty to the universe
that will become apparent when the right theory is proposed. I.e.,
the math will not be ugly if the theory represents truth. Engineers, however,
tend not to believe so strongly in truth forcing beautiful solutions.

OBSERVATIONS ON SCHOLARS' USE OF DIGITIZED RESOURCES
"[D]o many 'producers' of technological tools and systems pay much
attention to the unconvinced, indifferent, tired, frustrated, or
thwarted academic 'consumers'? Or do they simply dismiss many
nonadopters as aberrations, luddites, or dinosaurs, with little
reflection about the complex reasons why many scholars have not yet
embraced the promise of the 'new, new' technological thing?"
In "Use and Users of Digital Resources: A Survey Explored Scholars'
Attitudes about Educational Technology Environments in the Humanities"
(EDUCAUSE QUARTERLY, vol. 30, no. 7, 2007), Diane Harley, Senior
Researcher in the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the
University of California, Berkeley, reports on a survey of faculty in
the humanities and social sciences devised to "map the universe of
digital resources available to undergraduate educators . . . and to
examine how understanding use, users, and nonusers might benefit the
integration of these resources into scholarly environments." The survey
asked such questions as
-- how often faculty use various types of digital resources in their
        undergraduate teaching
-- why they don't use digital resources in certain teaching situations
-- why they have difficulty using digital resources the way they would
        like

In "Future Reading: Digitization and its Discontents" (THE NEW YORKER,
November 5, 2007) Anthony Grafton writes that "Google's projects
[Google Book Search, Google Publishing Partners], together with rival
initiatives by Microsoft and Amazon, have elicited millenarian
prophecies about the possibilities of digitized knowledge and the end
of the book as we know it. . . . Others have evoked even more utopian
prospects, such as a universal archive that will contain not only all
books and articles but all documents anywhere--the basis for a total
history of the human race." Grafton debunks the hyperbole as he traces
the history of information overload and the methods devised to control
it through the millennia. He predicts that "for the foreseeable future"
readers and scholars will rely on both digitized resources and the
collections still physically in libraries. "[S]treams of data, rich as
they are, will illuminate, rather than eliminate, books and prints and
manuscripts that only the library can put in front of you."

TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS FOR STUDENTS
In 1998, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)
published the National Educational Technology Standards for Students
(NETS-S), a "U.S. consensus defining what students needed to know about
and be able to do with technology. The standards, used in every U.S.
state and many countries, are credited by most with significantly
influencing expectations for students and creating a target of
excellence relating to technology."
In June 2007, ISTE released a new version of NETS-S that reflects the
changes in technology since 1998 and the changing expectations of
students' technical skills. The standard is available
<a href="http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=3DNETS">http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=3DNETS</a>.
The new standards are part of ISTE's NETS Refresh Project which will
introduce NETS for Teachers (NETS-T) in 2008 and NETS for
Administrators (NETS-A) in 2009.
ISTE is a nonprofit membership organization which "provides leadership
and service to improve teaching, learning, and school leadership by
advancing the effective use of technology in PK=AD12 and teacher
education." For more information, contact: ISTE, 1710 Rhode Island Ave

PREVENTING ONLINE EXAM CHEATING
"An instructor cannot have the same degree of control over the online
exam environment that they have for traditional classroom exams. For
this reason, we must re-design our exams (to the extent possible) to
ensure that they are effective in the online environment." In "Ways to
Prevent Cheating on Online Exams" (EDUCATOR'S VOICE, vol. 8, issue 6,
November 15, 2007), Gail E. Krovitz offers guidelines and tips to help
instructors reduce cheating when they use objective exams in online

CALL FOR PAPERS ON ACADEMICS IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
INNOVATE, edited by James Morrison, UNC-Chapel Hill Professor Emeritus,
is a peer-reviewed e-journal that began publication with the
October/November 2004 issue. The journal covers cutting-edge research
and practice in the field of using information technology tools to
enhance teaching and learning. Readers can also comment on articles,
share material with colleagues and friends, and participate in open
forums.
Innovate is soliciting manuscripts for a special issue on academics in
virtual environments. This issue focuses on the use of Multi-User
Virtual Environments (MUVEs) as an enhancement to education. A MUVE
combines graphics and audio with the ability to communicate with
multiple users in real time within the context of a 3-D virtual
environment. MUVEs are not necessarily considered games, as programs
like Second Life and There have no end goal or objective.

STUDIO THINKING: THE REAL BENEFITS OF VISUAL ARTS EDUCATION
By Lois Hetland, Ellen Winner, Shirley Veneema, and Kimberly M. Sheridan
New York: Teachers College Press, 2007
$24.95
ISBN 978-0-8077-4818-3
"The authors set out to tell us why arts education is important and to
give art teachers a research based language they can use to describe
what they teach, and what is learned. They reached their conclusions
after studying a number of well-taught studio classes in two schools.
Over the course of a year, they observed what they call a 'hidden
curriculum' that defines what art education is and what it does. Studio
Thinking presents their findings in a cohesive model along with lesson
examples and commentary. The authors say they want to 'change the
conversation about the arts in this country' and that could happen if
they can resurrect, or reinvigorate, some of their earlier work. Studio
Thinking presents what the authors say is the right 'reason' for arts
education as opposed to some other rationales, which they say, are just
plain wrong."

Subject: machines don't care
Date: Sun, 02 Dec 2007 20:36:52 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 533 (533)

Recently, in my role as lexicographical scout and collector for the
Dictionary of Words in the Wild (<a href="http://dictionary.mcmaster.ca/">http://dictionary.mcmaster.ca/</a>), I
spotted a new advert from a telephone-only banking service in the UK,
First Direct. The slogan on this advert is, "machines don't care".
Until I figured out the job that this slogan was supposed to be
doing, I thought it a negative statement, and so began musing about
getting one's fingers caught in meshing gears, being suddenly trapped
in some bureaucratic process and so forth. Then I realised that the
intent was quite the opposite -- the appeal of an automated banking
service being, I assume, that the machine doesn't care whether you're
spending too much and so forth. That brought me to the moral claim
made first by Freud, I think, that the great scientific discoveries
(Copernicus', Darwin's, Freud's own etc) were all blows to human
vanity, with the clear implication that the strength of science lies
in its liberation of the human spirit from vanity, its striving toward an
incorruptible programme of research. If memory serves Galileo
himself made such a statement. He would have observed much
corruption up close.
All that brought me further to the realisation that "machines don't
care", like "merely engineering", is an epistemologically useful
statement about the difference between what we build and who we are.
And that in turn to wondering whether Mr Turing's test should not at
some point be revised to determine if the unknown operant is a
feeling human being or a machine simulating emotion. Or perhaps the
problem is the separation in that test and elsewhere of thinking and
feeling, as I think is in effect what Antonio Damasio argues?

Date: Tue, 04 Dec 2007 08:04:22 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 534 (534)

Dear Willard,
We often seek to interact with entities that "don't care" regardless of
whether or not those entities are machines.  Physicians supposedly
"don't care" about our bodies the way our lovers might so we are allowed
to believe that our exposing our bodies to physicians risks no personal
judgment (about beauty, say, or desirability) on the part of the
physician.  Policemen supposedly don't care if we're stupid or foolish
when we ask for help.  Soldiers in combat don't care that the enemy are
human beings against whom they have no personal animus.  Not caring is
crucial for facilitating some functions important to humans and so we
create social categories that theoretically obviate caring.  In that
sense, machines may be perfect exemplars of roles we developed
collectively long before even the idea of those machines existed.  A
robot surgeon will never be misguided by its feelings; a robot policeman
will never unwittingly insult someone standing across the street from
the location sought.  A robot bombardier will not suffer remorse in
releasing its payload and become subsequently less effective.  In the
U.S., judges and juries are asked to consider demonstrable facts with no
weight given to any possible emotional responses the facts or witnesses
may occasion.  Banking functions are among those we usually want to be
uninfluenced by personal concerns such as impatience or favoritism, just
as we want bankers to perform mathematical calculations without any
possibility of the influence of fatigue.  While your revised reading of
"machines don't care" may suggest a useful revision of the Turing Test,
I think more broadly your rereading highlights the fact that, despite
the undeniable centrality of caring as a function of most people's ideas
of human beings, humans themselves often "steel themselves" (become
machine-like) in order to perform better the very functions human beings
need, and this denial of a "natural" caring is often considered
virtuous, as would any other discipline adopted at personal cost to lead
to socially desired ends.  The problem arises, of course, if the
discipline so influences us that we don't care when we should, if the
surgeon always sees people only as mechanical problems or the policemen
always sees people only as a job or the soldier always sees The Other
only as a target.  We want those who adopt roles that "don't care" to
maintain a dual cognition with the role as the conscious overlay, an
overlay we want to believe can be put aside.  Why?  Because we want to
believe that at bottom it is only a role, at bottom the surgeon wants to
heal us, the policeman to guide us, the soldier to protect us.  We want
caring to be the fundamental condition of these people, while not caring
is the role.  The disturbance one feels in having to revise your first
reading of the advertisement, I think, comes from having to acknowledge
that sometimes not caring is so important that we may be willing to give
up the notion that that is only a role and accept it as the fundamental
identity.  We would not want to do that with people because that would
dehumanize them and, by extension, suggest that we too could become
dehumanized and lose our identities.  But we don't mind inhuman machines
failing to be human.  It just takes a moment sometimes to accept the
notion that the inhuman may serve human desires better than humans can.
All best,
Eric

Subject: Irish Studies Online Queen's JSTOR Project Update
Date: Tue, 04 Dec 2007 08:07:13 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 535 (535)

Apologies for cross-posting.
Update Winter 2007
In the months since the last update the project has progressed at a
steady pace. Staff have been appointed, licences prepared and
circulated, digitisation is on-going and presentations have been
delivered at a range of key conferences.
Staffing
Three Research Assistants have been appointed to prepare publication
histories and indexing guidelines for every journal selected for
inclusion in the JSTOR Irish Studies Collection. A Production
Librarian from JSTOR came to Belfast in September to train the
Research Assistants so that all titles in this new collection have
the same rigorous metadata standards applied as other JSTOR
collections. This was an intense period for all concerned as it is
necessary for the Research Assistants to reach JSTOR's standard of
excellence every time they submit their work to JSTOR, there is no
gradual development of excellence over time, the gold standard must
always be achieved. The Irish journal titles are complex to analyse,
dual language, varying scripts and organisation are just some of the
elements which present challenges to JSTOR's experienced staff
responsible for answering queries presented by the Research
Assistants based at Queen's in Belfast.
Licences
Licence agreements between JSTOR and participating publishers were
prepared and circulated in early autumn by JSTOR to those publishers
who expressed an interest in having their journal archived in the
Irish Studies Collection. This project was made possible by funding
from the JISC, the finance is limited and the project must be
completed and the Irish Studies Collection ready for release in March
2009. There is a very narrow window of opportunity to have licences
circulated, discussed and signed to meet very tight production
deadlines. If a journal is to participate in the Irish Studies
Collection it is important that a signed licence is returned to JSTOR
as soon as possible otherwise an alternative title needs to be selected.
Phase I release Summer 2008
Work can't begin on a journal title until a licence has been signed
and delivered to JSTOR. Digitisation, post-processing, OCRing and
preparation of indexing guidelines must be completed in Belfast
before JSTOR can complete the process with the application of
metadata. To date almost 40 titles have been digitised and
post-processed by the Centre for Data Digitisation & Analysis at
Queen's. It is important that schedules are completed efficiently in
order to facilitate all elements of the production process and
release of the complete project on time. We hope to release the first
phase of journal titles in Summer 2008 with access to a mix of legacy
and in copyright titles.
Digitisation of monographs and manuscripts for inclusion in the Irish
Studies Collection will begin in Spring 2008 when digitisation of the
journals is complete.
Feedback
Presentations have been delivered in Ireland, UK and USA, feedback
indicates that there is tremendous interest in this
project.  Academics, researchers and students are looking forward to
access to the Irish Studies Collection and publishers to increased
international exposure for their journals.
If you would like more information on any of the issues commented
upon in this update please don't hesitate to contact me.

Subject: Tool Developer's Survey
Date: Tue, 04 Dec 2007 08:08:21 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 536 (536)

Colleagues,
Over the past few years, the idea of tool development as a scholarly
activity in the digital humanities has been gaining ground. It has
been the subject of numerous articles and conference presentations.
There has not been, however, a concerted effort to gather information
about the perceived value of tool development, not only as a
scholarly activity, but in relation to the tenure and promotion
process, as well as for the advancement of the field itself.
Ann Hanlon and myself have compiled such a survey and would be
grateful if those of you who are or have been engaged in tool
development for the digital humanities would take the time to
complete an online survey available at
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=zSMZSh1d3gltcmf6fkfd2g_3d_3d">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=zSMZSh1d3gltcmf6fkfd2g_3d_3d</a>
You will need to fill up a consent form before you begin, and there
is an opportunity to provide us with feedback on more than one tool
(you simply take the survey again). The survey should not take more
than 10-15 minutes. It is our intention to present the results of our
survey at Digital Humanities 2008.
With all best wishes,
Susan Schreibman

Subject: Second Life workshop with Alan Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin
Date: Tue, 04 Dec 2007 08:03:54 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 537 (537)

The workshop below is being held on Saturday, 
December 8, 2pm London time as part of _Intimacy: 
Across Visceral and Digital Performance_, at 
Goldsmith's College, University of London. If you 
are interested in more information or in 
participating, email Sandy Baldwin at charles.baldwin_at_mail.wvu.edu.
SECOND LIFE WORKSHOP: AVATAR PASTE AND CODE SOUP 
IN FIRST AND SECOND LIFE Leaders: SANDY BALDWIN, 
West Virginia University & ALAN SONDHEIM
This workshop will take place in the virtual 
world Second Life, and will be conducted by Alan 
Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin, with participation by 
other artists and performers in Second Life.
Participants from the Intimacy conference will be 
supplied with location and others details within 
Second Life. The workshop emerges from Sondheim 
and Baldwin's ongoing exploration of analog and 
digital bodies, using a range of technologies to 
remap the solid and obdurate real of bodies into 
the dispersions and virtualities of the digital, 
and then back again into real physical spaces. 
The "avatar paste" of the title means at least three things.
Firstly, the pasting of viewpoints together, the 
suturing of the subject into the avatar. 
Secondly, paste as glue, as half-liquid and half 
solid, as a materiality of renewable and infinite 
pliability. This is the chora of the avatar, the 
body matrix that is less a framework than a 
smearing of paste. And thirdly, paste as pasty 
and dis/comfortable substance, paste as slimy and 
dripping. While this abjection is already 
implicit in paste as glue, the pastiness of paste 
involves the projection and dreaming through of 
the avatar, the inhabitation of avatar bodies and 
the emptying of real bodies into the avatar.
"Avatar paste" comes out in avatar motions and 
behaviors. Firstly, these are formed by symbolic 
orders, presenting surfaces to read in terms of 
sexuality, power, emotion, and other projections. 
At the same time, the pasty avatar body tends 
towards collapse and abjection. Work on the 
avatar becomes a choreography of exposure and 
rupture, modeling and presenting inconceivable 
and untenable data, within which tensions and 
relationships are immediate and intimate. One 
might imagine, then, this inconceivable data as a 
form of organism itself: as part of a natural 
world or a world already given; out of this we 
might think through new ideas of landscape, 
wilderness, hard ecology, the earth itself.
The workshop will theorize and demonstrate these 
topics. The first part discusses theoretical 
frameworks.Alan Sondheim will discuss topics of 
dismemberment, telepresence, and abjection in 
relation to the motion and behavior of Second 
Life avatars. Sandy Baldwin will discuss the 
topography of limits in Second Life, both body 
limits and spatial limits, an connect this to 
issues of the hunt and animal display.
He will also discuss the dynamics of performance 
and audience in Second Life. The second part of 
the workshop will show off Sondheim and Baldwin's 
approach to re-mapping live bodies into Second 
Life performances, including: video and other 
examples of motion capture and scanning; 
intermediate processing of files (e.g. editing 
.bvh data or working with Blender); and then the 
resulting works, including documents of Second 
Life performances and re-mappings back into 
"first life" spaces with dancers and other live 
performers. The final part of the workshop will 
include avatar performance by Sondheim, Baldwin, 
and other participants in Second Life.

CALL FOR PAPERS
ICTs Bridging Cultures? Theories, Obstacles, Best Practices
6th International Conference on Cultural 
Attitudes towards Technology and Communication (CATaC08)
24-27 June 2008
Universite de Nmes, France
Conference languages: English and French
www.catacconference.org
The biennial CATaC conference series - 10 years 
old in 2008! - provides a premier international 
forum for current research on how diverse 
cultural elements shape the implementation and 
use of information and communication technologies 
(ICTs). The conference series brings together 
scholars from around the globe who provide 
diverse cultural and disciplinary perspectives in 
their presentations and discussions of the 
conference theme and topics (listed below).
Nmes, inhabited by Celts since the 4th ct. 
B.C.E., became a Gallo-Roman city in 18 BCE, and 
is home to some of the best-preserved examples of 
Roman engineering and architecture.  The Pont de 
Gard, an aquaduct bridge across the Gard river, 
serves as our primary metaphor for CATaC 2008: 
ICTs as technologies bridging cultures.  Our 
venue in multi-cultural Nmes further provides us 
with a number of cultural experiences and 
pleasures unique to the South of France. Finally, 
CATaC 2008 emphasizes francophone participation 
in a number of ways, including, translation 
provided for abstracts in French and English, and 
for questions and answers following presentations.
Original full papers (especially those which 
connect theoretical frameworks with specific 
examples of cultural values, practices, etc.) and 
short papers (e.g. describing current research 
projects and preliminary results) are invited.
TOPICS include but are not limited to:
- Language as a core issue in cultural diversity 
with IT: are languages shaping a new IT world?
- CMC as fostering and/or threatening cultural diversity
- Theoretical and practical approaches to 
analyzing "culture" and its impact on the use and implementation of ICTs
- ICTs in the francophone world, including: 
influences of francophone usages globally and cross-cultural comparisons
- Beyond glocalization and homogenization: new 
mixtures of identities and cultures as facilitated by ICTs
- Empowerment and CMC, including issues of 
gender, languages and power (economic, political, social)
- Values, ethics, justice, and ICTS
- Cultural and linguistic diversity and e-learning
SUBMISSIONS
All submissions will be peer reviewed by an 
international panel of scholars and researchers. 
Accepted papers will appear in the conference 
proceedings. Submission of a paper implies that 
it has not been submitted or published elsewhere. 
At least one author of each accepted paper is 
expected to present the paper at the conference.
Schedule:
- Full papers (maximum 15 formatted pages) - 14 January 2008
- Short and panel papers (3-5 formatted pages) - 21 January 2008
- Notification of acceptance  - mid February 2008
- Final formatted papers  - 28 February 2008
The review process will be handled electronically 
through a review system, linked to the conference 
website. Papers may be submitted in either French 
or English. We strongly encourage submissions to 
include abstracts both in French and English, 
since accepted papers will be published in the 
Proceedings with abstracts in both languages. We 
will translate abstracts if necessary. Accepted 
papers must be formatted according to the 
conference proceedings template (download from www.catacconference.org).
KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
The keynote speakers are Marie-Franoise 
Narcy-Combes, University of Nantes, and Jean-Paul

Subject: designing an intelligent system (natural)
Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2007 08:29:20 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 539 (539)

In the Liber Amicorum, a festschrift for Prof.dr. H. Jaap van den
Herik published this year on the occasion of his 60th birthday, Don
Beal concludes his brief contribution, "Intelligent Systems,
Artificial and Natural", by drawing our attention to the notion of
collective intelligence. He notes that, "Human institutions vary in
the degree of collective intelligence they exhibit. Worthwhile though
they are, some human institutions perform mainly routine functions,
not requiring much collective intelligence, even though they may rely
heavily on intelligent staff within them in order to function" (pp.
3-4). He then turns to the contributions of the man honoured, Jaap
van den Herik, the most important of which, he says, "is Jaap's role
in that collective human intelligence that is the world's
universities. He has built intelligent systems, originally at Delft
and then at Maastricht, that delivered as their outputs dozens of
PhDs. These intelligent systems react to the humans who enter the
postgraduate program, provide their research needs, inform and guide
their research, and eventually accrete the graduate into humanity's
collective brain" (p. 4). The intelligence of these social systems,
Beal writes, "lies partly in the individual intelligences of the
peoples embedded in them, but also in the emergent collective
intelligence of the whole enterprise."
In considering our programmes of instruction, we would be well
advised, I think, to look on them, to design them as intelligent
systems, not relying merely on the fact that they are stocked with
very smart people (one assumes). Beal's observation that such a
system may itself be quite stupid is a sobering one.
Perhaps one needs a certain kind of society in order to focus
sufficient effort into forging such intellectual collectivity and to
bring it about in a way that would not stifle creative work but
nurture it. (Social consensus is, I understand, commonly identified
as a Dutch virtue.) I suspect it's much more difficult in some
national societies than it is in others. But even so, it's difficult
not to conclude that PhD programmes capable of intellectual
collectivization would be training students to give back to their
societies something as valuable as the work they are paid to do.
There has to be more to it than simply working together with others
during the PhD and afterwards. If there were not, then such praise as
Beal gives to van den Herik's administrative work would be
commonplace in the sciences. But this seems not to be the case. Or
are our scientific colleagues better off in this respect?
Comments?
Yours,

Subject: Fwd: 21.390 machines don't care
Date: Tue, 04 Dec 2007 08:54:24 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 541 (541)

In the best spirit of Humanist, Eric's refining of my musings on
"machines don't care" takes the discussion forward by pointing out
the obvious, that we can as a matter of perceived necessity or
otherwise steel ourselves against feeling. We can become in effect
less complex beings, even verge on a robotic state of purely
bio-mechanical action, as soldiers do in parade. When, say, we act as
a surgeon, or a policeman, or a bank teller, or indeed as a
university teacher (who officially should not care about a student's
personal difficulties, at least up to a point), what distinguishes us
from the machine that can now or will, perhaps, replace us someday?
Isn't it the point at which we step out of the role Eric speaks of,
the point at which the policeman steps outside of his or her official
set of constraints and helps the person in trouble directly?
When Western Europeans (I assume sometime in the 17C) first
encountered the great apes, a fair amount of anxiety was generated
because of the obvious similarities, raising the obvious question of
what the differences were. (See Swift's Gulliver's Travels.) Now
primatologists study how much we are like the apes, and some people
argue that we'd be much better off if we were more like them. Still
it's the difference that is of interest. When humans do something
bestial, what makes it so? What makes the bestial action so much
worse than the same action performed by beasts?
I come back to my revised Turing Test: can the unknown actor step
outside the robotic role and display empathy? This has to be a rather
subtle test, as we know from Joseph Weizenbaum's Eliza. How would we know?
Yours,
WM

Dear Eric and Willard,
There are levels and levels of not caring. The problem with machines
is that the machine itself contains no restricts of any kind on how
it is used. Exactly the same technology is used to administer
life-saving transfusions and (in the US) lethal injections. For the
machine, it is all the same. This, if I remember correctly, was a
main reason why Heidegger was so hostile to the increasing
enslavement of industrial countries by their technologies -- computer
technologies and the internet, for example. It is the substitution of
purposelessness for purpose, emotionlessness for emotion, utter lack
of sociality for social connectedness, and so on.

Dear Willard,
Has someone pointed you to Richard Powers excellent novel about AI
"Galatea 2.2". The narrator, Powers his unreliable self, and others
accept a challenge to develop an AI that can pass an English MA
comprehensive. Along the way Powers looks at the Turing Test and its
ethical dimension - would we deny humanity to someone whose
disabilities made them unable to pass a Turning test? I won't spoil
the end, but the caring and love of an AI is the twist that animates
the ending. If you could create such an AI so it cared, what would it
think about itself and its inability to physically express its love?
What makes the novel particularly interesting is its realism - Powers
studied at the University of Illinois, was a programmer, and returned
to U of Illinois as a writer-in-residence - an experience that he
plays with for Galatea 2.2 to the point you can almost believe it
happened. That this account reads so authentically about academic
life and research make it all the more compelling as a essay on the
ethics of AI. It is about what some of us may be doing already.
I should also mention a short story by Powers, called "Literary
Devices" Zoetrope: All-Story (Winter 2002, Vol. 6, No. 4). The blurb
on the Zoetrope site (where you can order it) reads:
"Richard Powers speculates about the narrative complications of the
digital age. By invitation of an anonymous e-mail, his narrator tests
a computer program, DIALOGOS, which weaves its stories from bits of
data around the web, without any central
authorship. He sends out e- mails into the
DIALOGOS void-- to Emma Thompson, to an estranged
friend, to Goethe, to Emily Dickinson. Each missive is returned with
implausible accuracy. In time, the narrator gets lost in DIALOGOS,
and wonders if he has lost touch with reality or if the reality of
narrative has in fact been changed."
I haven't been able to find DIALOGOS, but not for lack of trying.
Perhaps I have lost touch with reality.
Yours,
Geoffrey Rockwell

Subject: cognitive science like alchemy?
Date: Wed,  5 Dec 2007 10:55:49 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 544 (544)

Dear colleagues,
I have rattling around in my head fragments of a quotation, which I
think is from Richard Rorty but cannot find in his works, to the
effect that one day neurobiology will do to cognitive science what
chemistry did to alchemy. The parallel is rather commonly made, for
example by John Searle, and comparing an intellectual practice you
don't like to alchemy is hardly rare. But the words I remember reading
were a particularly economical and effective way of asserting a
person's belief that cognitive science is a folk-science.
This note is *not* intended to provoke ferocious debate about the
solidity of cognitive science or lack of same, though that might be
quite enjoyable. I merely want to get the quotation right and
correctly attributed.
Many thanks.
Yours,
WM

In his A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive (1843),
obtainable in its entirely from The Online Library of Liberty
(<a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/">http://oll.libertyfund.org/</a>), John Stuart Mill, arguing against
Aristotle, writes that the successive general propositions of a
syllogism are not steps in reasoning nor intermediate links in a
chain of inference but mechanisms we require because of the natural
constraints of the minds we have. He goes on:
[deleted quotation]Now that we have "sufficiently capacious memories, and a sufficient
power of maintaining order among a huge mass of details", though
artificial, where are we in respect of this argument? What has
happened to these inferential formulae, and how has it happened?

We now have computers proving mathematical theorems in which the proof is so
voluminious when written out that it cannot be followed by human beings.
Whereas before a proof had to be "elegant" by elimination of enumeration as a
step, we now can have computers use enumeration of thousands of special cases
and their individual proofs well beyond what human beings would consider a
successful methodology.
In a larger sense, the problem is that the proofs will become inaccessible to
humans as a means of studying the growth of knowledge. They will have to be
accepted.
There was a similar dilemma facing early artificial intelligence investigators
at MIT. I believe it was Samuel's Checker playing software which could beat
human beings--but whose logic for making moves was inaccessible becasue it
wasn't based on a theory that could be explained. This approach was rejected by
Marvin Minsky because he noted that it did not reveal to us anything about the
game of Checkers.
This is the larger dilemma facing us. If we build computer software
that can use
pure statistical modeling to predict results we may know the answers without
being able to understand why those are the answers.

A joint workshop of the EPSRC Service-Oriented Software Research
Network (SOSoRNet) and the AHRC ICT Methods Network on 17 - 18
December 2007 at King's College London.
A key message to emerge from the first SOCH workshop
(<<a href="http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act17.html">http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act17.html</a>><a href="http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act17.html">http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act17.html</a>), 
held at King's one year ago, is that communities of practice in the
humanities are increasingly turning to service-oriented approaches as
their data becomes ever more complex and dispersed. This second event
will seek to provide those researchers a forum for intensive
discussion, framed by a highly focused group of international
speakers from the cutting edge of service-oriented research as
applied to the humanities (with examples from music, archaeology and
medieval history); as well as from academics working with tools and
resources that have the potential to develop new research
methodologies based around the service-oriented approach.
The programme of invited speakers will include:
- David de Roure, University of Southampton
- mc schraefel, University of Southampton
- Michael Meredith, University of Sheffield
- Stuart Jeffrey, Archaeology Data Service
- Xavier Llora, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
- J. Stephen Downie, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
This workshop is likely to be of interest to any humanist researcher
working with, or interested in, advanced network technologies, as
well as to computer scientists who are interested in learning more
about this new and rapidly developing area of application.
Participation is free and open to all, but registration is essential.

CONFERENCE AIMS
FOMI  is an  international  forum where  academic  researchers and
industrial practitioners meet to analyze and discuss issues related
to methods, theories, tools and applications based on formal ontologies.
There  is  today wide  agreement  that  knowledge  modeling and  the
semantic dimension  of information  plays  an
increasingly  central  role in networked economy: semantic-based
applications are  relevant in distributed systems such
as  networked  organizations,  organizational  networks,  and  in
distributed knowledge  management. These  knowledge models  in
industry  aim to provide a
framework  for   information  and  knowledge  sharing,   reliable
information exchange, meaning negotiation and  coordination between
distinct organizations or among members of the same organization.
New  tools and  applications  have been  and are  being  developed
in  diverse application fields,  ranging from  business to  medicine,
from engineering to finance,  from  law
to  electronics.  All  these  systems have exploited  the
theoretical  results and  the practical  experience of  previous
work.  In all cases,  it has  been  shown that  formal  ontologies
play  a  central role  in describing  in
a  common  and  understandable way  the  logical and practical
features of the application domain.
The  success  of the  methodologies  associated  with knowledge
modeling  and ontologies led to increased need  of a comparison
between different approaches and results, with the aim of evaluating
the interdependencies between theories and methods  of formal
ontology  and the  activities, processes, and needs of enterprise
organizations.
The FOMI  08 Workshop aims to  advance in this direction  by bringing
together researchers  and  practitioners  interested in  ontology
application,  paying particular  attention to   the  topics   listed  below.

Subject: regularities in law-less practices
Date: Fri, 07 Dec 2007 09:03:14 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 552 (552)

In an important new book, Science without Laws: Model Systems, Cases,
Exemplary Narratives, ed. Angela Creager, Elizabeth Lunbeck and
Norton Wise (Duke, 2007), the several authors collected together here
consider how a range of disciplines achieve their coherence and
explanatory power not on the basis of abstract laws but by developing
exemplary objects. These disciplines range from the biological
sciences (in which model organisms fulfill that role), through
economics (with its game theorizing based e.g. on The Prisoner's
Dilemma), to anthropology (specific ritual practices) and, as Carlo
Ginzburg calls it, microhistory. It's a brilliant collection of
essays, each of which would make for a good discussion, but to keep
this brief and at least close to the humanities, I'll mention only
Clifford Geertz's piece on anthropological ritual and Ginzburg's on
the life-history of a late 17C merchant, Jean-Pierre Purry. The
question I want to work toward here is this: what exemplary models
might we be developing in humanities computing?
Geertz, in "'To exist is to have confidence in one's way of being':
Rituals as model systems", surveys the rituals that have emerged from
the beginnings of anthropology, concentrating on Malinowski's
Trobriand kula and Turner's Ndembu mukanda. His title relates not
primarily to what we have learned about particular rituals in
culturally if not geographically distant societies but to what ritual
did and does, for those societies and for us -- providing, as he says
at the end, "a model system of a particular way of engaging with the
real, of worlding the world" (222). From a disciplinary perspective,
the crucial point in the development of anthropology came when ritual
changed from a question to a means of seeking answers: "From being an
object *to* study, a sort of sociological natural kind, it became an
object to study *with*, a means and a modality: the microscope, not
the bug under it" (213). Particular rituals became "model systems" --
cases which gained a stability and transferrability that made them
common disciplinary tools to think with.
Ginzburg, in "Latitude, Slaves, and the Bible", traces his
inspiration for microhistorical writing to Eric Auerbach's strategy
of developing "Ansatzpunkte", concrete details from which global
processes can be reconstructed. Ginzburg asks, "can an individual
case, if explored in depth, be theoretically relevant?" (679f). The
microhistory of Purry's adventurous life constitutes, one might say,
something like John Milton's use of his own autobiography "in specie
aeternitatis", as a means to reflect on the eternal or transpersonal
correlate of a particular mortal career -- a particular man as a
means of glimpsing human kind, or man as Man, to use older
terminology. Like Milton Ginzburg does this by connecting Purry's
recorded thoughts and actions with the biblical narrative according
to which he consciously lived his life. Ginzburg uses that life as an
exemplification of a broad historical reality, connecting the one to
the other through common participation not so much in beliefs as in a
way of thinking.
Had Northrop Frye been alive when this collection of essays was
assembled, my guess is that he would have contributed an essay,
connected to the rest, as may be obvious, through Ginzburg's
brilliant argument. Unfortunately literary criticism is not
represented here, though it could have been by adding what Frye
called literary archetypes to the list of methodological entities in
the subtitle of Science without Laws.
What cases do we have to think with? I've repeatedly argued that one
should not think in terms of models but modelling, i.e. the restless
process of computing rather than any software product, and on
occasion I've approvingly cited Alan Perlis' epigrammatic question:
"Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is
meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap
bubble?" (74, <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html">http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html</a>). Yet clearly we are
not adrift on a sea of constant change. Particular software models
may be soap-bubbly, but exemplary studies, which inform all work that
follows them, we do have. In the area of statistical analysis of
literature, one thinks immediately of Mosteller and Wallace. What
others would you name?
In the technical area of text-encoding, the TEI would seem to be a
model system -- one might say, a certain kind of ritual by which text
is made intelligible within the computational world. Relational
database design would seem to be another, a "data model", as we say.
The KWIC concordance yet another. In each case we name not a product
but a kind of stable intellectual object. Is John Burrows' Delta
another one of these?
Let me end by quoting the final paragraph from Science without Laws,
from Mary S. Morgan's Afterword:

Intriguing, all of this ;  developments we'd indeed do well to
keep an eye on, it seems to me.
[deleted quotation]I really wish I had a good answer off the top of my head.
I'm certainly not myself anything like expert in such matters,
and in fact too incompetent even to think of trying to offer
any meaningful response. But I note that fortunately there
are places where one might be able to look for a bit of
informed guidance.
As far as *deduction* is concerned, one might well turn,
for example, to the writings of someone like Wolfgang
Bibel, maybe starting with his (invited talk) "Early history
and perspectives of automated deduction", which has just
appeared on p.2-18 of _KI 2007 : Advances in artificial

An older look-to-the-future may also be worth checking
on :  D.W. Loveland, "Automated deduction looking ahead",
_AI Magazine_ 20.1 (1999), p.77-98.
I'd also recommend D. Hutter's article "Deduction as an
engineering science", in _Electronic notes in theoretical
computer science_ 86.1 (2003), p.3-10 ;  and B.
Gramlich's "Strategic issues, problems and challenges in
inductive theorem proving", in the same periodical 125.2
(2005), p.5-43.
Interesting and relevant in a more general way is Arkoudas
and Bringsjord's very recent "Computers, justification, and
mathematical knowledge", in _Minds and machines_ 17.2
(2007), p.185-202. Certainly also Tyler Burge's "Computer
proof, a priori knowledge, and other minds: the Sixth
_Philosophical perspectives_ lecture", in _Philosophical
perspectives_ 12 (1998), p.1-37. Also worth looking at
is the (mathematics-oriented) "Platonism, constructivism,
and computer proofs vs. proofs by hand", by Yuri Gurevich,
which appeared (in augmented form) in _Current trends in
theoretical computer science : entering the 21st century_ /
ed. by G.Paun [et al.] (Singapore : World Scientific, 2001),
p.281-302.
More possibilities, without going into really technical stuff
or too far back in time :  Donald MacKenzie, _Mechanizing
proof : computing, risk, and trust_ (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT
Press, 2001) (ISBN 0-262-13393-8), and the critical review
of that book by Otavio Bueno & Jody Azzouni in _Philosophia
mathematica_ 13.3 (2005), p.319-325 ;  and  Samuel R. Buss
[et al.], "The prospects for mathematical logic in the twenty-
first century", in _Bulletin of symbolic logic_ 7.2 (2001), p.
169-196.
There are other good things available, but that ought to be
enough for those curious about such questions to get started.
(Alas I don't myself have the time these days to follow them
and similar things up, but -- like Willard -- I'd sure like to
hear more from anyone who has a handle on these matters.)

Call for Papers
Thinking Beyond Borders: The Promise of Computing for the Humanities
2008 Annual Meeting of the Society for Digital Humanities / Socit pour
l'tude des mdias interactifs
The Society for Digital Humanities (SDH/SEMI) invites scholars and
graduate students to submit proposals for papers and sessions for its
annual meeting, which will be held June 2 - 3 at the 2008 Congress of
the Social Sciences and Humanities, University of British Columbia.
The society would like in particular to encourage submissions relating
to the central theme of the Congress "Thinking Beyond Borders" or our
society&#x2019;s sub-theme "the promise of computing for the Humanities."
Computing in the humanities has long been synonymous with
interdisciplinary work, whether research, scholarship, teaching, or some
combination of those elements. With such a strong history of thinking
beyond traditional disciplinary borders, the digital humanities offers
immense promise for the future. And while digital technology has enabled
us to think beyond the borders of our respective academic disciplines,
it has also enabled us to think beyond the borders of the local and even
the global campus. That is, networking and collaboration have become
viable between multiple scholars working at multiple institutions, but
they have also enabled the participation of non-scholars working outside
the purview of academia. Nor are the borders between creators and
collaborators the only borders we can now routinely think beyond; the
products of our intellectual labour now more readily cross the
traditional border between town and gown.
While this year&#x2019;s Congress theme seems 
particularly well suited to the interests of 
SDH/SEMI, we encourage submissions on all topics 
relating to both theory and praxis in the 
evolving fields of digital humanities. Potential 
topics include, but are not limited to:
Humanities computing as an means of bridging disciplinary communities
Reports on / plans to establish networks within and beyond academia
Facility and large project management
Crossing the border from the physical to the virtual
The computer as a generative or analytical tool in humanities research
Humanities computing and pedagogy
Crossing the border from material to digital culture (or vice versa)
Computer enabled / supported collaboration
Computer modeling in humanities research
The history and future of humanities computing / digital humanities
Computing in the fine, performing, and new media arts
SDH/SEMI is working with other national societies, including the
Association of Canadian College and University Teachers of English
(ACCUTE), the Bibliographical Society of Canada (BSC), and the
Association for the Study of Book Culture/Association canadienne pour
l&#x2019;tude de l&#x2019;histoire du livre (ASBC/ACEH), to once again present joint
sessions. Proposals for inclusion in a joint session should indicate
such a preference. All submissions to SDH/SEMI will be considered to be
eligible for inclusion in a joint session or in independent SDH/SEMI
sessions. Those wishing to submit their proposal through one of the
associations with which SDH/SEMI will collaborate must follow the
submission requirements of the specific association.
There is some funding available to support graduate student
participation, and in keeping with the forward-looking nature of
SDH/SEMI graduate students are strongly encouraged to submit.
Paper and/or session proposals will be accepted until December 14, 2007.
Presentation at the conference is available to all members of SDH/SEMI
and other groups in the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organisations.
Presentation in joint sessions is open to those who hold a membership in
at least one of the participating associations. Membership in SDH/SEMI
is available on-line at SDH/SEMI (2007) & Oxford Journals (2008).
Abstracts/proposals should include the following information: title of
paper, author's name(s); complete mailing address, including e-mail;
institutional affiliation and rank, if any, of the author; statement of
need for audio-visual equipment. Abstracts of papers should clearly
indicate the paper's thesis, methodology and conclusion.

La socit voudrait encourager tout spcialement les propositions qui se
rapprochent du thme du congrs Penser au-del des frontires ou de
son sous-thme : Les promesses de l&#x2019;informatique en sciences humaines.
L&#x2019;informatique en sciences humaines a longtemps t synonyme de travail
interdisciplinaire, tant au plan de la recherche qu&#x2019; ceux des
programmes d&#x2019;tudes ou d&#x2019;enseignement. Solidement ancre dans son
habitude de penser en dehors des frontires disciplinaires,
l&#x2019;informatique en sciences humaines offre plein de promesses. En plus de
nous permettre de penser au-del des frontires de nos disciplines
respectives, la technologie numrique nous permet aussi de penser
au-del des frontires du campus local et mme global. Le rseautage et
la collaboration sont devenus viables entre de nombreux universitaires
travaillant dans une varit d&#x2019;institutions et favorisent aussi la
participation de chercheurs qui travaillent en dehors de la sphre
universitaire. Enfin, les frontires entre crateurs et collaborateurs
ne sont pas les seules que nous puissions envisager de dpasser : nos
productions intellectuelles traversent maintenant plus facilement la
frontire qui sparait traditionnellement le bureau de la maison.
Mme si le thme du Congrs 2008 semble particulirement bien adapt aux
intrts de la SEMI/SDH, nous encourageons toute proposition dans des
domaines relis aussi bien  la thorie qu&#x2019; la pratique dans
l&#x2019;informatique en sciences humaines. Cela inclut les thmes suivants,
sans que cette liste soit ferme : Informatique en sciences humaines
comme moyen de crer des ponts entre les disciplines
Projets de rseaux ou comptes rendus 
d&#x2019;expriences  l&#x2019;intrieur des milieux universitaires et au-del
Gestion d&#x2019;installations et de grands projets

Subject: an editorial plea
Date: Mon, 10 Dec 2007 08:49:59 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 555 (555)

Dear colleagues,
This is a plea from your editor, who for noble reasons hereby puts on
the robe of the long-suffering, self-sacrificing public servant. (I
do not in fact suffer. Rather I get annoyed. And I'd hardly say that
editing Humanist is an act of self-sacrifice, though some of my time
goes to the care of Humanist that might be spent drinking coffee and
checking out my neighbours, or whatever. But please assume for now
that I am wearing said robe, play along with me and see what emotions
and consequent actions result.)
Some contributors to Humanist, whose identities will not be revealed,
compose their postings in a wordprocessor, using all the glories of
its formatting options (bullet-points, proper quotation marks &c &c),
and then paste the result directly into their e-mail client and send
it off. What said individuals apparently do not realise is that in
doing so they paste in all sorts of proprietary formatting codes that
my software doesn't like, i.e. these codes become visible nonsense to
me. I then have to take the content of each of these messages,
massage it with a text-editor, then paste the corrected content back
into my e-mail client for the actual posting. Sometimes several
search-and-replace operations are involved. Frankly it's a hassle.
Now while I admit that suffering this hassle may improve my soul,
teach me patience and love for my fellow human beings great
enough to surmount considerable annoyance with them, I'd rather not
be improved in such ways early each morning. As I'm sure everyone
knows, ordinary life comes up with quite enough improving tests of that sort.
Rumour has it that improved software for Humanist will come along
someday soon. Perhaps then I will be shielded from the slings and
arrows of outrageous formatting. I will let you know when I feel thus
protected, and then you can try your worst. But meanwhile, please,
take care with your special effects. Such care will be felt, and
this, I think, will work marvellous improvements to my ability to
maintain emotional equilibrium. Who knows, joy might even follow.
Yours,
WM

Date: Tue, 11 Dec 2007 06:55:03 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 556 (556)

MIght I suggest: Dembski? NOTE:
"Cognitive science is legitimate science when it takes an
unprejudiced view of the relation between computation and
intelligence. Nevertheless, since cognitive scientists as a group are
notorious for deciding the issue in advance, I shall henceforth refer
to cognitive science qua science as the science of cognition. Thus I
shall use the phrase cognitive science pejoratively, implying that
science and philosophy have been conflated because intelligence was
prejudged as a form of computation. My view is that cognitive science
stands to the science of cognition much as alchemy stood to
chemistry. Certainly the alchemist's appeal to magic renders him more
ridiculous to modern eyes than the cognitive scientist's appeal to a
well-established materialist philosophy. But to my mind the cognitive
scientist's conflation of philosophy and science is no less damaging
to the science of cognition than the alchemist's conflation of magic
and science was to chemistry. The fault of the cognitive scientist
does not lie in his being simultaneously a philosopher and a
scientist, but in not telling us when he is serving in which
capacity. My purpose in this article is to untease that tangled web
of philosophy and science which constitutes cognitive science."

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 557 (557)

Two examples (not from cognitive science) of how intimately computing
has affected the language we use:
(1) an advert on a bus for some insecticide that would "debug" your house;
(2) an unsolicited e-mail promising to change my "male device size".
The latter of these is grist for Ian Hacking's latest mill, for which
see "Our Neo-Cartesian Bodies in Parts", Critical Inquiry 24 (Autumn
2007): 78-105.
Other examples? Until now I thought that scanning the spam I get was
without its rewards. I now know differently.

Date: Tue, 11 Dec 2007 06:55:26 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 558 (558)

After reading Ian Beardley's _Decoding the Universe_ I am of the mind 
that this property of knowing answers without understanding them is 
one not unique to computers, although quantum physics and the 
computer are very closely connected via information theory.
We do not understand why atomic particles behave as they do (see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition</a>), but we are able 
to do pretty amazing computations because they behave in predictable 
patterns, however strange or unintuitive.
There is a strong epistemological question here, however.   Computers 
seem to offer a choice to humans about the way they will understand 
time and space; quantum information doesn't give us a choice -- it 
behaves how it behaves and that's it.    But we are in an era where 
people are looking for the existence of quantum computers.    Have we 
assumed wrongly that the computer mirrors human thought when in fact 
it may mirror something more fundamental (ie. quantum 
motion/behavior)?   Perhaps we do not have a choice at all?

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 559 (559)

Dear colleagues,
Joe Raben reasonably asks in the following what would help in the
processing of Humanist messages. I think the answer is (at the risk
of saying something that is imprecise) PLAIN TEXT, by which I mean
unformatted text in any language using the Roman alphabet. Since
almost all text in Humanist is in English anyhow, the only common
enhancement comes via names, about which I am of course not
complaining. My only complaint is with formatting, the source of
which, I'd guess, is in 99.99...% of the cases due to Microsoft Word.
If I am in any doubt about text I am using in composing a message, I
run it through a plain-text-only editor first. My favourite editor is
the Programmer's File Editor, a simple, fast and elegant piece of
work, but it is no longer supported, so I can hardly recommend it.
Perhaps others here will have recommendations for editors that show
more or less exactly what one is getting?
Yours,
WM

Constraints and Language Processing
CALL FOR PAPERS
5th International Workshop on Constraints and Language Processing (CSLP2008)
<a href="http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2008.html">http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2008.html</a>
August 11-15, 2008
organized as part of the European Summer School 
on Logic, Language and Information ESSLLI 2008 
(<a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/">http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/</a>), 4-15 August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany
Workshop Organizers:
Philippe Blache (Provence University, France)
Henning Christiansen (Roskilde University, Denmark), co-chair henning_at_ruc.dk
Veronica Dahl (Simon Fraser University, Canada)
Jrgen Villadsen (Technical University of Denmark), co-chair jv_at_imm.dtu.dk
Workshop Purpose:
The CSLP 2008 workshop addresses the question of 
constraints and language processing from an 
interdisciplinary perspective. Constraints are 
widely used in linguistics, computer science, and 
psychology. How they are used, however, varies 
widely according to the research domain: natural 
language processing, knowledge representation, 
cognitive modelling, problem solving
mechanisms, etc. The purpose is to pursue a 
paradigm, unifying the different approaches into 
a common framework capable of explaining how 
constraints play a role in representing, 
processing and acquiring linguistic information, 
and this from a formal, technical, and cognitive perspective.
Workshop Topics:
The topics include, but are not limited to, 
constraint-based linguistic theories, constraints 
in human language comprehension and production, 
context modelling and discourse interpretation, 
acquisition of constraints, probabilistic 
constraint-based reasoning, constraint satisfaction
technologies and constraint logic programming.
Submission details:
Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 12 pages in PDF format.
The font size must be at least 10 pt when printed on A4 paper.
It is recommended that the LaTeX "article" style is used.
Previously published papers cannot be accepted.
The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee.
The accepted papers will appear in the workshop 
proceedings published by ESSLLI.
One author for each accepted paper must attend 
the workshop in order to present the paper.
A volume at an international publisher will be 
considered for selected and revised papers, if 
number and quality of submissions permits.
Please use the CSLP 2008 submission page handled 
by the EasyChair conference system: 
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=CSLP2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=CSLP2008</a>
Workshop format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants.
It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held 
over five consecutive days in the second week of ESSLLI.

Open Scholarship: Authority, Community and Sustainability in the Age of Web 2.0
Scholarly communications, in particular scholarly publications, are
undergoing tremendous changes. Researchers, universities, funding
bodies, research libraries and publishers are responding in different
ways, from active experimentation, adaptation, to strong resistance.
The ELPUB2008 conference will focus on key issues on the future of
scholarly communications resulting from the intersection of semantic
web technologies, the development of cyberinfrastructure for
humanities and the sciences, and new dissemination channels and
business models. We welcome a wide variety of papers from members of
these communities whose research and experiments are transforming the
nature of scholarly communications. Topics include but are not restricted to:
*   New Publishing models, tools, services and roles
*   New scholarly constructs and discourse methods
*   Innovative business models for scholarly publishing
*   Multilingual and multimodal interfaces
*   Services and technology for specific user communities, media, and content
*   Content search, analysis and retrieval
*   Interoperability, scalability and middleware infrastructure to
facilitate awareness and discovery
*   Personalisation technologies (e.g. social tagging, folksonomies,
RSS, microformats)
*   Metadata creation, usage and interoperability
*   Semantic web issues
*   Data mining, text harvesting, and dynamic formatting
*   User generated content and its relation to publisher's content
*   Usage and citation impact
*   Security, privacy and copyright issues
*   Digital preservation, content authentication
*   Recommendations, guidelines, interoperability standards

ABOUT ELPUB
The ELPUB 2008 conference will keep the tradition of the previous
international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the
United Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999),
Russia (2000), the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil
(2004), Belgium (2005), Bulgaria (2006) and Austria (2007), which is
to bring together researchers, lecturers, librarians, developers,
business executives, entrepreneurs, managers, users and all those
interested in issues regarding electronic publishing in a wide
variety of contexts. These include the human, cultural, economic,
social, technological, legal, commercial, and other relevant aspects
that such an exciting theme encompasses.
Three distinguishing features of this conference are: broad scope of
topics which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and
learning about various aspects of scholarly communications and
electronic publishing; combination of general and technical issues;
and a condensed procedure of submission, revision and publication of
proceedings which guarantees presentations of most recent work.
ELPUB 2008 offers a variety of activities, such as workshops,
tutorials, panel debates, poster presentation and demonstrations.  A
variety of social events and sight-seeing tours will be available to
participants (at additional costs). Please see the conference web
site for details.
Conference Location: Toronto, Canada. Toronto is one of the most
vibrant cities in North-America. It has a large multicultural
population, is the largest city in Canada and the 5th-largest city in
North America. There are many world class galleries and museums
across the city and you will find authentic cuisines from around the
world at reasonable prices.
Conference Host: Knowledge Media Design Institute (KMDI), University
of Toronto. KMDI  is a graduate research and teaching institute at
the University of Toronto, and an intellectual incubator fostering
cross-disciplinary initiatives across the university. The work of the
institute spans both the scientific study of the ways in which media
shapes and is shaped by human activity, and the practical work of
founding an interdisciplinary nexus for design and evaluation of both
media and media technologies. KMDI has acknowledged leadership,
substantial research programs and broad participation in three major
areas: collaboration and collaboration technologies, the phenomenon
of openness and new forms of knowledge production and dissemination,
and public policy and citizen engagement.

Dear Prof. McCarty,
this article (available on Jstor) seems to be a (the?) source for the
analogy between psychology and alchemy:
P. M. Churchland, "Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional
Attitudes", Journal of Philosophy 1981 pp. 67-90. Especially pp. 80-82.

Subject: the analogy of alchemy
Date: Wed, 12 Dec 2007 08:04:06 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 564 (564)

The quotation I am still looking for is cleverer than the candidates
so far offered -- until Churchland's, kindly located by Cesare
Pastorino (see the other note in this number of Humanist). But I am
still looking, because Churchland's is not exactly the wording I
recall, to the effect that one day 'neurobiology will do to cognitive
science what chemistry did to alchemy'. One essential element of the
statement I am looking for is there, which is to say, the use of
alchemy in an analogy involving neuroscience, but cognitive science
isn't mentioned. However, Churchland's treatment is worth a bit of
commentary here, I think.
Churchland is arguing that our commonsense beliefs, a.k.a. "folk
psychology" (FP), may be considered a theory of mind, and when one
thinks of them in this way, as a theory, then we can see that they
get us nowhere. On the contrary,  he writes (p. 75),
[deleted quotation]In contrast,
[deleted quotation]There are several things to question here. I wonder in particular
about the soundness of translating our native, non-theorized ways of
navigating the world into a propositional theory, then comparing this
theory to the consensus Churchland sees gathering in the
materialistic sciences. To put the matter in other words, I wonder
specifically about the meaning(s) of "theory" in these two rather
different contexts. I also wonder about the historicity of "how
alchemy *must have looked* as elemental chemistry was taking form".
I'd very much appreciate comments on what historians know of that
moment other than from the perspective of modern elemental chemistry.
How did things look *then*, to those for whom the future was all
unknown, all its possibilities unrealised?
As we strengthen our own argument for humanities computing as an
intellectual practice of its own (distinct from but related to the
argument for each of the digital humanities), understanding how real
history is done seems to me part of the job. And that means doing
much, much better than laughing at a defeated, superceded past. To
get to the core of our matter, it seems to me that we need to know
and be able to talk about computing not as a fruit of triumphalist
techno-science and so a great gift to the Johnny-come-lately,
slow-witted, catch-up humanities but as a humanistic and humane
subject from its several beginnings. As true as that may be, however,
my nomination for our most important contribution to the humanities
is the development of computing as a means of dissolving away the
barrier of misunderstanding between the sciences and the humanities,
which among other things means understanding the sciences
historically. The standard argument as I understand it is that we
have a real subject to talk about when we are able to see its
chronological record not as a string of fundamental facts, as in the
onward-and-upward story of progress -- but as questions to answered.
I keep wondering (and here am eager for comment) how it is that as
humanists we can feel so comfortable ignoring so much of what human
beings have thought and done under the rubric of science?

          organizing ability
After reading Ian Beardley's _Decoding the Universe_ I am of the mind
that this property of knowing answers without understanding them is
one not unique to computers, although quantum physics and the
computer are very closely connected via information theory.
We do not understand why atomic particles behave as they do (see
<<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition</a>><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition</a> 
), but we are able
to do pretty amazing computations because they behave in predictable
patterns, however strange or unintuitive.
There is a strong epistemological question here, however.   Computers
seem to offer a choice to humans about the way they will understand
time and space; quantum information doesn't give us a choice -- it
behaves how it behaves and that's it.    But we are in an era where
people are looking for the existence of quantum computers.    Have we
assumed wrongly that the computer mirrors human thought when in fact
it may mirror something more fundamental (ie. quantum
motion/behavior)?   Perhaps we do not have a choice at all?

Hi Willard,
For Windows text editors I highly recommend Ultraedit
(<a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">http://www.ultraedit.com/</a>) I have been using the program since about 1996 &
seen it grow impressively with features without bloating into a software
monster. It's not free but it is inexpensive. It is designed for programmers
(syntax checkers etc) and works brilliantly to process text files of almost
any size & has many UNIX features built into the Windows program.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 568 (568)

Willard,
What connection do you see between computing humanists respecting our
history and the history of precursor activities and the comparison
between cognitive science and alchemy? It is not disrespecting
history, I think, to say that the theory underlying alchemy turned
out to be false and was supplanted by chemistry, which, after some
false starts (remember phlogiston? ether?) turned out to be, so far
as we know 'til now, mostly true.
Btw, I think the big issue for the Churchlands is not whether folk
psychology is a theory -- much of it is at least a simple-minded
proto-theory, as causal statements such as 'If you insult someone, he
or she will usually get angry' show. The big issue is, what would
follow from such statements turning out to be false, or too inprecise
and unquantifiable to be the basis of a science? Would it follow that
there is no consciousness, belief, desire, emotion, aspirations,
......? The Churchlands think that it would because they think that
the meanings of theoretical terms are so closely tied to the
theory/ies in which they are found that if the theory/ies turn/s out
to be false, the terms are not talking about anything that exists.
But this linkage is, to say the least, open to question -- a question
that is much stronger in the case of terms such as our vocabulary for
the mind that play a massively central role in practical life and so
are anchored there than in the case of terms such a phlogiston, where
C&C might be at least partly right.
Well, there is more to be said but I will stop. The first question is
the one that interests me at the moment. What connection to you see
between respecting our history and the claim that cognitive science
may go the way of alchemy?

Dear colleagues,
This morning (GMT) Humanist reached its 1600th subscription for the
first time since it began. (Membership does go up and down a bit, so
it may reach this mark again.) It did so because I found several
requests for subscription that had somehow been lost in the welter of
e-mail. (Apologies to those involved.) Among the overlooked is one
from Megan Hurst, at one time associated with Harvard University
Libraries and the founder of a company called Mho Media Inc.
Unfortunately Ms Hurst put the wrong sort of information where her
e-mail address should have gone, so I am unable to do anything about
this request. Nor can I find an e-mail address for her online. If
anyone knows Ms Hurst and her e-mail address, please let me know.
Then, perhaps, she can be number 1601.
Many thanks.

Date: Fri, 14 Dec 2007 07:39:45 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 570 (570)

Chemists followed alchemists,
but cognitive scientists today work cordially,
side-by-side, with neuroscientists.
Both study mental behaviour
but use different tools to do so.
In my opinion, the alchemy metaphor falls apart,
whoever said it,
but digital humanists should make up their own minds.
I recommend two get-acquainted books:
Friedemann Pulvermller's"The Neuroscience of Language:
On Brain Circuits of Words and Serial Order"
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002).
A monograph.
Gregory and Bridget Robinson-Riegler's
"Cognitive Psychology: Applying the Science of the Mind"
(Boston: Pearson, 2004).
A textbook.
After these,
start reading journals
where the newest findings and theories compete,
and where neuroscience and cognitive sciences
advance together symbiotically.
For example, three theories now vie to explain
the cognitive deterioration in language
amply shown in the healthy aging population
(not those suffering from a dementia).
These theories are the inhibitory-deficit model
(an inability to filter out irrelevant information),
the processing-speed model
(mental functions slow down),
and the context-processing-deficit model.
The third model, proposed in 2001,
now appears to be the strongest candidate.
As I understand it,
the context-processing-deficit model proposes
that the elderly (those past 65) have trouble
(compared to young people)
in representing, maintaining, and updating
-- within working memory --
information ("cues")
about the context of a concept ("probes").
This accounts for much mischief,
including difficulty in using new knowledge,
and associative failure.
See Beth K. Rush, Deanna M. Barch, and Todd S. Braver,
"Accounting for Cognitive Aging:
Context Processing, Inhibition or Processing Speed,"
in the journal "Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition,"
13 (2006): 588-610.
This new theory builds on results
that independent teams of researchers
have obtained from the simple AX-CPT experiment
with human subjects.
It also supports a theory in neuroscience
that locates cognitive aging
in the executive function of the prefrontal cortex.
Elegant, lucid, and helpful.
Beautifully symbiotic.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 571 (571)

Andrew Brooks has asked what connection I am seeing "between
computing humanists respecting our history and the history of
precursor activities and the comparison
between cognitive science and alchemy?" He points out that,
[deleted quotation]True, from the perspective of modern chemistry. But what I was trying
to argue, apparently not very well, was this: that to the historian
rather than to the chemist the event in question looks different, and
if we're to have a proper history of our subject, we have to
understand the nature of that difference.
Let us say that we could find an historical moment, series of moments
and/or one or more particular individuals involved in the
alchemical-chemical scene. Doing the best we can to reconstruct how
things looked then to the people alive then, who didn't know how the
matter was going to be resolved -- for the most sophisticated of
whom, one might say, "how the matter was going to be resolved"  would
not even be a coherent statement -- what would we see? My guess is
that we'd come up with something very much like the historical scenes
Siegfried Zielinski reconstructs in Deep Time of the Media (MIT
Press, 2006; review by me in the next LLC). As it happens I have no
particular interest in alchemy (though perhaps I should), but I am
very interested in how a proper history would work out a view of it.
In one of his papers on the historiography of science, Michael
Mahoney (www.princeton.edu/~mike/) points out that once a scientific
problem is solved, it becomes exceedingly difficult for the
knowledgeable person to imagine what the world looked like before the
solution was arrived at. What we tend to see is a more or less
straight line of development from the beginnings of something or
other, through the solutions of various problems and inventions of
new devices, to what we know now and have now. If we're sure of our
facts, that's fine, because indeed X did lead to Y, and Y to Z etc.
But, as I understand it, that's not an historian's view.
About our thing. What would we see if we had a proper history of it?
My guess is we'd arrive at something very much like Mahoney's attempt
at a history of computer science's beginnings, in "Software as
Science - Science as Software"
(www.princeton.edu/~mike/softsci.htm). We'd see a complex
strand of developments, agendas coming together, separating,
recombining. We'd see a number of possible historical paths to where
we are now, one seeming preferable to another depending on what we
think we're doing now. The fact is all we have now for humanities
computing are essentially chronologies. Northrop Frye pointed out at
the beginning of Anatomy of Criticism, for criticism, that one does
not have a real subject until one is able to turn the chronological
facts into problems to be explained, then starts to explain them. A
history supplies that explanation, but because it is not a matter of
facts alone as of their careful selection and interpretation, it is
something that has to be rewritten from time to time. As a real
historian said to me once, we get the histories we need.
I suspect that once we have a history for humanities computing, there
will no longer be any doubt on anyone's part that "humanities
computing" is not a contradiction in terms, that instead it's more
like male-female or day-night -- or yang-yin.
Comments?

[deleted quotation]When Willard first posed his query, I too had the feeling that
I'd read that before, and indeed probably somewhere in Rorty.
But I couldn't, and after thinking about it for a few days still
can't, place it. (Maybe I've just read too *much* Rorty since
his 1979 breakthrough). I do still have the feeling, though, that
we're dealing with a Rortian formulation -- rather than with one
from the subsequently mentioned Dreyfus or the Churchlands.
But there *is* at least, I see now, another publication, later
than the passage we apparently were remembering, in which
Rorty considered the same subject and took the same sort of
stance -- and which anyone who's interested therefore may
want to have a look at in this connection. It's his article called
"The brain as hardware, culture as software", which appeared
in _Inquiry_ 47.3 (June, 2004 -- Symposium Vincent
Descombes, The mind's provisions), on p.219-235.
And, interestingly enough, the indictment on "alchemy" was
cleverly turned back on Rorty ("a very bright alchemist . . .,
while what is needed is a superb chemist"), by Tibor
Machan, in his "Indefatigable alchemist: Richard Rorty's
radical pragmatism", _American Scholar_ 65.3 (Summer,
1996), p.417-424.
Ian Lancashire's most interesting remarks on cognitive
theories remind me that there was a time (1980s and
into the 1990s) when the "cognitive paradigm" was
dominant in the field of information retrieval research
and of information needs, seeking and use ("INSU")
studies in general. For more than ten years now the
fashion has been, at least in INSU, to make light of
(at least the tendancy to accept the overriding or even
unique validity of) that paradigm, with the implied
question "how could we ever have been so
unsophisticated as to take such a simplistic view
of the processes and factors involved".
Willard also wrote :
[deleted quotation]Maybe because it's so much easier that way (and the actual
academic risks, peculiarly, remain low). Which doesn't make
it -- indeed -- any the less regrettable, from both disciplinary
perspectives.
And he furthermore wrote :
[deleted quotation]Nor, fortunately, as I understand it, a sociologist's :-).

At our center Notepad++ has recently become the tool of choice for

Liberal Arts" - Academic Commons special issue released today
Monday Dec 17, 2005
Academic Commons today released its December 2007 special issue
devoted to CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE & THE LIBERAL ARTS
(www.academiccommons.org/).
Edited by David L. Green (Principal at Knowledge Culture), the issue
is dedicated to the memory of Roy Rosenzweig (1950-2007), an
extraordinary historian who inspired a generation of fellow
historians and others working at the intersection of the humanities
and new technologies (<a href="http://thanksroy.org/">http://thanksroy.org/</a>).
Cyberinfrastructure offers the liberal arts new resources and new
ways of working - with revolutionary computing capabilities, massive
data resources and distributed human expertise. How will students,
scholars, teachers, librarians, museum professionals and others
connect, use and contribute to these new capabilities? Will humanists
work collaboratively and produce new forms of scholarship "more
interesting than the book"? How will institutions change the way they
do business in putting cyberinfrastructure to work?
This collection of essays, interviews and reviews captures the
perspectives of scholars, scientists, information technologists and
administrators on the challenges and opportunities
cyberinfrastructure presents for the liberal arts and liberal arts
colleges. What difference will cyberinfrastructure make and how
should we prepare?

Digital Document Quarterly 6.4 (<a href="http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/ddq.htm">http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/ddq.htm</a>)
DDQ 6(4) recommends four books, and provides brief reviews:
        David Lindley's Uncertainty: Einstein,
Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science
        Ernst Cassirer's The Logical Structure of
the Humanities, and also his An Essay on Man
        Amos Elon's The Pity of It All
At the 2007 ECDL conference, Seamus Ross
summarized the state of the art of digital
preservation with, "[No] concise and
well-developed strategy that represents the views
of a broad community has yet emerged.  Since 1989
at least twelve have been published."  He
continues with, "as a community we need to
re-think how we are approaching research -- [and]
need to engage -- researchers in this process, and
especially those with a strong computing science and engineering=
  background."
Readers of DDQ might also be interested in an
article that responds to this invitation, Economics and Engineering
for Preserving Digital Content.  An online
preprint version is available at
<<a href="http://eprints.erpanet.org/139/">http://eprints.erpanet.org/139/</a>>.
Its abstract reads:
Progress towards practical long-term preservation
seems stalled.  We preservationists cannot afford
unique technology, but must exploit marketplace
offerings.  Macro economic facts suggest shifting
most preservation work from repository institutions to their users.
Prior publications describe conceptual solutions
for all known challenges of preserving a single
object, but do not deal with software development
or collection scaling.  Much of the software
needed is available.  It has, however, not yet
been selected, adapted, integrated, or deployed
for digital preservation.  Tools for daily work
can embed packaging for preservation without much burdening their users.
We describe a practical strategy for detailed
design and implementation.  Document handling is
complicated by human sensitivity to communication
nuances.  Our engineering section therefore
suggests how project managers can master the many pertinent details.

Dear Willard,
About a month ago, you wrote:
[deleted quotation]Imagine, for a moment, that the human race had somehow made the
planet unlivable. (I know: this is a stretch.) A combination of
climate instability and poisoning of the biosphere is making land and
ocean uninhabitable. Fortunately for us, however, scientific advances
and technical breakthroughs have combined to make it possible for
humanity to begin colonizing space. On the moon and in orbit, and in
increasingly far-flung missions to other planetary systems, we are
learning to harvest energy and matter from available scrap, dust and
ambient radiation, and create for ourselves livable ecosystems for
hundreds and thousands of people, plants, and creatures of every
description. The engineering of these systems is demanding and
precarious, complex beyond the understanding even of their
originators, and requiring as much art as science. But it is
succeeding to the point where entire generations are now being born
and brought up in other worlds off-earth. Electrical mechanics,
nuclear physics, metallurgy, biology and biochemistry, and sometimes
plumbing (except relying on acceleration as much as on gravity), are
all required for the development and maintenance of these systems.
In such a world, does someone ask whether learning electricity or
metallurgy or biochemistry or astrophysics is really worthwhile, and
not just for their practicality but for themselves -- not just what
they are today, but also what they can be tomorrow?
And when you hire an econautical engineer for your Mars mission, do
you want one for whom your ship is the first microbiosphere, or one
who has helped to build, cultivate and pilot a few in school?
Having imagined this, can you offer an argument for why we should not
suppose we are already in this predicament ... except that the toxins
besetting us include ignorance, hatred and war, and we don't have the
option of retreating into space? Is there any work more vital and
urgent than understanding, developing and building a sustainable
information ecosystem in which the most inclusive possible science,
economy, culture and diplomacy of the future can flourish?
With all best wishes for the holidays,
Wendell

De: Christian-Emil Ore <c.e.s.ore_at_EDD.UIO.NO>
First Announcement of the 2008 CIDOC Annual Conference
Dear all,
In 2008 the CIDOC annual meeting will be held in Athens, Greece from
September 15 to 18 and will be organized by the Hellenic Committee of
ICOM and the Benaki Museum. Please find additional information in French
and English below.
Kind regards,
Christian-Emil Ore
Chair  CIDOC
Theme: "The Digital Curation of Cultural Heritage"
Digital curation emerged as an important new concept in the theory and
management of cultural information. It covers all of the actions needed
to maintain digitised and born-digital cultural objects and data, going
beyond digital preservation to encompass their utilisation in the
context of their entire life cycle, from acquisition and appraisal to
exhibition, learning and commercial exploitation. The focus of CIDOC
2008 on the digital curation of cultural heritage will allow curators,
collection managers, documentalists,  archivists and museum information
specialists to explore a broad range of theoretical, methodological,
professional practice and technological issuers related to the
appraisal, digitisation, management, representation, access and use of
digital cultural assets, such as those increasingly becoming part of
museum information systems and digital archives. A core emphasis of the
meeting will be to understand and re-contextualise the know-how and
history of established curatorial practice in museums, and memory
institutions, in general, in the new field of digital cultural heritage;
to review and discuss the applicability of standards- and good
practice-related work in the context of managing digital cultural
information; and to identify and explore the issues, methods and
challenges involved with the development of new genres and contexts of
virtual exhibition, e-learning and technology-enhanced services for
scholarship and research.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 585 (585)

Dear all,
[sorry for any x-posting]
A new issue of Human IT is now available at
<a href="http://www.hb.se/bhs/ith/2-9/">http://www.hb.se/bhs/ith/2-9/</a>
This issue contains articles on a wide range of topics. Of particular
interest to Humanists is probably Alois Pichler*s and Gjermund
Lanestedt*s article on the Wittgenstein Archives, the DISCOVERY
project and the future of scholarly editing. There are also two articles
concerned with information seeking and information credibility in
different types of educational environments: the youngest schoolchildren
and university students. Finally, from a quite different point of view,

Subject: AHRC Call for Technical Reviewers
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2007 09:29:21 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 587 (587)

Dear Humanists
I'm forwarding this on behalf of the AHRC. I'd very much encourage UK
members to respond to this. As you will all be aware we are in urgent
need of well qualified people to comment on the technical aspects of
applications for AHRC funding after the demise of the AHDS. So it's
really important to recruit an excellent group of reviewers to ensure
that applications are well treated.
Best wishes,
Claire
--------------
Dear Colleague,
The AHRC is inviting applications for Technical Reviewers to be
appointed to its Peer Review College from Spring 2008.
Technical Reviewers will provide advice, as part of the AHRC's
assessment process, on technical aspects of proposals submitted for
funding. Reviewers therefore need to have the relevant expertise to
comment authoritatively on the technical aspects of research
projects, as described in the Technical Appendix form submitted with
funding applications. In particular, we are seeking people with
expertise in one or more of the following areas: project management
of technical aspects; data development methods; data/file formats;
infrastructural support (hardware and software); data preservation
and sustainability.
Technical Reviewers will be expected to review Technical Appendix
forms across all areas of the arts and humanities subject domain. If
a reviewer's expertise is limited to particular subject areas, this
should be stated on the application form. Please note that we are not
looking to appoint technical reviewers specializing in archaeology,
as the AHRC will be obtaining such expertise through its support of
the Archaeology Data Service (ADS).
Applications are welcomed from all those who meet the criteria
attached at *Appendix C* to the application form, including
researchers already serving on the College as academic peer
reviewers, as well as those who are not currently College members. In
the case of the latter, technical reviewers will be appointed to
provide technical reviews only. College members are normally
appointed for a term of three years and appointments will commence in
May 2008. There is no remuneration but College members are reimbursed
for travel and subsistence expenses incurred on AHRC business.
Anyone who wishes to apply to be a technical reviewer should complete
the application form which can be downloaded **from
<a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/about/peerreview/call_technical_reviewers.asp">http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/about/peerreview/call_technical_reviewers.asp</a>**.**
Completed forms must be accompanied by a summary CV and publications
list and sent either by email to nominations_at_ahrc.ac.uk
<mailto:nominations_at_ahrc.ac.uk> or by post to Julia Davidson, Peer
Review Development Officer, AHRC, Whitefriars, Lewins Mead, Bristol
BS1 2AE. The closing date for applications is *Thursday 31 January
2008*. Any queries about the application process should be directed
to Julia Davidson at j.davidson_at_ahrc.ac.uk
<mailto:j.davidson_at_ahrc.ac.uk>. Any queries about the technical
review process should be directed to Ian Broadbridge, Programme
Manager at i.broadbridge_at_ahrc.ac.uk <mailto:i.broadbridge_at_ahrc.ac.uk>.
*Background*
In May 2007 Professor Philip Esler, Chief Executive of the AHRC,
wrote to all Heads of Higher Education Institutions about the
Council's decision to discontinue AHRC support for the Arts and
Humanities Data Service (AHDS) from March 2008. Further information
is available **here**
<<a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/news/news_pr/2007/information_for_applicants_to_AHRC_june_deadline.asp">http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/news/news_pr/2007/information_for_applicants_to_AHRC_june_deadline.asp</a>>. 
The AHRC has, however, elected to continue its support of the
Archaeology Data Service (ADS) for a further five years, because of
its centrality to the AHRC's Science and Heritage strategy.

Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2007 09:32:14 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 590 (590)

On the exchanges between Willard, myself and few others on computing
humanists respecting our history and the history of precursor
activities and the comparison between cognitive science and alchemy:
I won't quote the previous messages, which have tended to be lengthy.
Willard, I entirely agree with you that how the history of an
activity looked to the participants is often, maybe always, very
different from how it looks to later folk who know how things turned
out. What I was unclear about it what you wanted to build on that
fact. Certainly if what we want is accurate, informative history,
reconstructing how things had to have looked to participants is
important, even essential. But what if our interest is in knowing
what our current activities are like, activity where we don't know
the outcome. There are definitely two (or more) schools of thought on
this and I have never known how to resolve the disagreement.
Then there is my original question: How does the issue of doing
history well connect to the chemistry replacing alchemy issue? Part
of my reason for asking is that in the humanities computing game,
there has never been a similar 'paradigm shift', to use Kuhn's
maligned word, just incremental developments -- lots and lot of
incremental developments but no epochs in which one kind of theory
gets trashed in favour of another.
My two cents' worth.

Following the increase in the use of gaming within Classics (including
the recent CA panel, presentations at the digital classicists seminar
and elsewhere and Shawn Graham's Case Study on Civilisation as a
teaching tool, please see
<a href="http://www.hca.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/case_Studies/Re-Playing_History">http://www.hca.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/case_Studies/Re-Playing_History</a>
-The_Year_of_the_Four_Emperors_and_Civilization_IV.php) I thought it
worth circulating this call for papers...
Call for Papers (deadline 15th February)
Research has shown that games applications that are designed to do more
than entertain (aka 'serious games') can effectively engage learning.
Hence this conference seeks to bring together leading researchers and
developers with interested professionals in education and training in
order to stimulate debate on the design and deployment of serious games,
including mobile learning games. Submissions are invited on all aspects
of serious games that are relevant to learning and teaching.

Subject: Diane Middlebrook (1941-2007)
Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2007 09:31:22 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 592 (592)

Dear colleagues,
Diane Middlebrook, literary biographer and former professor of
English at Stanford, died a few days ago, on 15 December, at age 68.
A report about her life from the Stanford News Service may be found
at
<a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2008/january9/middlebrook-010908.html">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2008/january9/middlebrook-010908.html</a>.
What you will not find reported possibly anywhere other than here is
her interest in humanities computing. Diane and I met because of a
shared devotion to Ovid. I do not recall whether at the time she was
already interested in computing, but if not she became so soon after
we met. Her indefagitable curiousity could not have let computing
alone -- and didn't. She began some efforts to interest her
colleagues in English at Stanford, which included a departmental
roundtable discussion she got me to lead in 1998 and a lively
discussion with a group of her students. Sometime later she resigned
her position at Stanford to pay full attention to writing. Perhaps
had she remained in her post at Stanford a while longer humanities
computing would have taken hold earlier and in a stronger form than
it has. Who could have resisted her? In any case, she is one of my
primary examples of the kind of scholar we need more of -- someone
whose mind is both powerful and open, and therefore, as Peter
Matthiessen said, "at play in the fields of the Lord".
Of those two qualities, of power and openness, the latter seems to me
to be much the rarer among our kind. Many of you will know Isaiah
Berlin's essay, "The Hedgehog and the Fox", whose categorical
distinction is based on Archilochus' fragmentary statement, "The fox
knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing." Others here
may know Diane's former colleague Richard Rorty's Gadamerian sermon,
"Being that can be understood is language" (London Review of Books,
16 March 2000: 23-5). In that sermon (his word),  reprinted in
Gadamer's Repurcussions: Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics,
University of California Press, 2004, Rorty envisions a philosophical
utopia in which philosophers "have at last abandoned the scientistic,
problem-solving, model of philosophical activity with which Kant
burdened our discipline. They will have substituted a conversational
model, one in which philosophical success is measured by horizons
fused rather than problems solved, or even by problems dissolved. In
this philosophical utopia, the historian of philosophy will not
choose her descriptive vocabulary with an eye to distinguishing the
real and permanent problems of philosophy from the transient
pseudo-problems. Rather, she will choose the vocabulary that enables
her to describe as many past figures as possible as taking part in a
single, coherent conversation" (25). She, and we all, will be
fox-hedgehogs, who know many big things that sum to one very big
thing. That, at least, seems to me the kind we are and need to
become. Diane was one of those who led the way.
Yours,
WM

In Humanist 21.429, Andrew Brook wrote,
[deleted quotation]Let me take a run at a reply. I'd think that having an accurate,
informative history would only be of interest if it helped us, as he
says, to know what our current activities are like. An historian
might answer differently to other historians, but I'd think that if
he or she were talking to non-historians, then doing history would be
justified in terms similar to Andrew's. So the question is, why
should we go to so much trouble?
One answer would be to understand as much of what is at work in the
present as possible. If in any given historical moment there are many
latent possibilities, outcomes of what has happened and interactions
among those outcomes, then a history that shows the origins and
nature of these possibilities would help us to read them. Another
answer would be to show continuities obscured by misconceptions, e.g.
the ongoing philosophical problem that runs through the work of
Hilbert, Goedel and Turing to the present day, which overlooked
contributes to the false belief that computing is a purely technical
phenomenon of significance to us only instrumentally. I suppose one
could understand the situation by imagining a traveller who quite
suddenly suffers a case of total amnesia, and so has no idea why he
is carrying what he is carrying, what the items in his luggage are
for, where he was going, why &c. Borges has shown us that the
traveller with perfect recall and total knowledge may be in an even
worse fix, but since partial amnesia seems a condition of existence,
and forgetting more the real danger, we don't have to worry much
about overdoing it.
This is such a fascinating problem I'd think one could find many
schools of thought about it. But can we say, irrespective of school,
that in order to know the present (so that one can make well informed
decisions &c) one must know the past?
Andrew continues:
[deleted quotation]What *exactly* happened when chemistry replaced alchemy? Is
"replaced" the right word? I'd think that an historical response
would construe this lengthy and complex event as a type of what we
now call scientific progress, i.e. it would help us to understand the
idea of scientific progress. With that improved idea, we'd then
proceed to examine other instances, opening them up to see what was
gained (from our current perspective), what was lost. Kuhn's primary
source was the history of physics. What happens to his argument if we
look instead at the history of chemistry, or the history of biology
-- or the history of computing? Am I right in thinking that we have
been so profoundly influenced by the history of physics -- by the
notion that all sciences are reducible to physics, including (when we
can get around to it) the human sciences -- that basing our idea of
the fundamental science elsewhere constitutes a major meta-paradigm
shift? An even more radical meta-paradigm shift would perhaps result
if we ditched the notion of a fundamental science altogether for a
thorough-going relativism and, as I think Rorty has suggested, start
working seriously on our abilities to talk across disciplinary
discourses, collegially, as humanities computing is trying to do.

CALL FOR PAPERS
INTERNET RESEARCH 9.0: RETHINKING COMMUNITY, RETHINKING PLACE
International and Interdisciplinary Conference of the Association of
Internet Researchers (AoIR)
Copenhagen, Denmark
Workshops / Doctoral Colloquium: October 15th, 2008
AoIR. conference: October 1618th, 2007
Deadline for paper submissions: February 8th, 2007
RETHINKING COMMUNITY, RETHINKING PLACE
In the past few years, new forms of net-based communities have emerged,
distributed on various websites and services, and making use of several
media platforms and genres to stay connected. Now, as mobile and
location-based technologies are reintroducing "place" as an important
aspect in the formation of communal and social activities, it is time to
consider and rethink the concept of online or virtual communities. Not
forgetting the lessons we have learned from studying the early virtual
communities, how do we describe, analyse, theorise and design the
communities and social formations of the early 21st century? How do we
address the blurring of boundaries between places and communities on-
and offline?
We call for papers, panel proposals, and presentations from any
discipline, methodology, and community, and from conjunctions of
multiple disciplines, methodologies and academic communities that
address the conference themes.
Sessions at the conference will be established that specifically address
the conference themes, and we welcome innovative, exciting, and
unexpected takes on those themes. We also welcome submissions on topics
that address social, cultural, political, economic, and/or aesthetic
aspects of the Internet beyond the conference themes. In all cases, we
welcome disciplinary and interdisciplinary submissions as well as
international collaborations from both AoIR and non-AoIR members.
SUBMISSIONS
We seek proposals for several different kinds of contributions. We
welcome proposals for traditional academic conference papers, but we
also encourage proposals for creative or aesthetic presentations that
are distinct from a traditional written &#x2018;paper.&#x2019;
We also welcome proposals for ROUNDTABLE SESSIONS that will focus on
discussion and interaction among conference delegates, as well as
organized PANEL PROPOSALS that present a coherent group of papers on a
single theme.
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
All papers and presentations in this session will be reviewed in the
normal manner. Detailed information about review and submission will be
available through the conference submission 
website: <a href="http://conferences.aoir.org">http://conferences.aoir.org</a>
in early January 2008.
Format
- PAPERS (individual or multi-author) - submit abstract of  600-800
words
- CREATIVE OR AESTHETIC PRESENTATIONS - submit abstract of 500-750
words
- PANEL PROPOSALS - submit a 600-800 word description of the panel
theme, plus 250-500 word abstract for each paper or presentation
- ROUNDTABLE PROPOSALS - submit a statement indicating the nature of the
roundtable discussion and interaction
Papers, presentations and panels will be selected from the submitted
proposals on the basis of multiple blind peer review, coordinated and
overseen by the Program Chair. Each individual is invited to submit a
proposal for 1 paper or 1 presentation. A person may also propose a
panel session, which may include a second paper that they are
presenting. An individual may also submit a roundtable proposal. You may
be listed as co-author on additional papers as long as you are not
presenting them.
PUBLICATION OF PAPERS
Several publishing opportunities are expected to be available through
journals, including a special issue of "Information, Communication &
Society", based on peer-review of full papers. The website will
contain more
details.
GRADUATE STUDENTS
Graduate students are strongly encouraged to submit proposals. Any
student paper is eligible for consideration for the AoIR graduate
student award. Students wishing to be a candidate for the Student Award
must send a final paper by June 30, 2007.
Ph.D. students will also want to consider participating in the Doctoral
Colloquium: Following the very successful examples of previous Doctoral
Colloquia, we will again aim to offer an all-day Doctoral Colloquium on
October 15th 2008 (Wednesday) for Ph.D. students who wish to present
their current work for critical evaluation by their peers and senior
scholars. Submission and registration details will be available on the
conference website <a href="http://conferences.aoir.org">http://conferences.aoir.org</a> as soon as possible.
PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS
Prior to the conference, there will be a limited number of pre-
conference workshops which will provide participants with in-depth,
hands-on and/or creative opportunities. We invite proposals for these
pre-conference workshops. Local presenters are encouraged to propose
workshops that will invite visiting researchers into their labs or
studios or locales. Proposals should be no more than 1000 words, and
should clearly outline the purpose, methodology, structure, costs,
equipment and minimal attendance required, as well as explaining its
relevance to the conference as a whole. Proposals will be accepted if
they demonstrate that the workshop will add significantly to the overall
program in terms of thematic depth, hands on experience, or local
opportunities for scholarly or artistic connections. These proposals and
all inquiries regarding pre-conference proposals should be submitted as
soon as possible to both the Conference Chair and Program Chair and no
later than March 31, 2007.

Subject: Digital humanities at the 2007 MLA Convention
Date: Fri, 21 Dec 2007 11:54:35 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 596 (596)

Some Humanist readers may be attending this year's Modern Language
Association convention in Chicago, starting on Thursday the 27th.
There are a number of talks on digital humanities and related subjects
at the MLA, and to help those interested in finding them, the
Association for Computers and the Humanities has compiled a guide to
these talks, based on the convention program.  It is available at:
            <a href="http://www.ach.org/mla/mla07/guide.html">http://www.ach.org/mla/mla07/guide.html</a>
The level of d.h. activity at the MLA has risen for the second year
running, and as always the range of subjects these sessions touch on
covers many languages and kinds of study.  There's the first mention
of GPS that I've seen in the title of an MLA paper--- you can tell
that it's something new to this venue when an acronym gets explained
within the title itself.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 597 (597)

Dear colleagues,
Today, the shortest of the year, Christmas came early for me. This
year the normal shutting down of my main machine in celebration of
the joyous time I celebrate came automatically, without bidding.
Sometime during the night or this morning, when I attempted to revive
the machine for a day of work, it packed up and went into total
hibernation. The power-supply appears to have fizzled. Repair is
promised for Monday, but Monday is Christmas Eve. So I turn to my
laptop in order not to miss the opportunity to send out my usual
message for the season. Otherwise all important files remain stranded
on the now totally inert box at my feet, so effectively I am being
forced to abandon scheduled work for the many other non-digital
things hereabouts, like books.
One of these is Michael Sappol's Dream Anatomy, catalogue of an
exhibition put on by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, with a
fine website, www.nlm.nih.gov/dreamanatomy/. Sappol writes "about a
set of longstanding issues in the history of anatomical
representation" and how our ideas about ourselves are affected, even
shaped by such representation. Phrenological diagrams are to be
expected and are relevant to our interests, but what lies closer are
the ones which fit the reigning technologies of the time to functions
of the brain, e.g. Fritz Kahn's Das Leben des Menschen (1926).
(Several of Kahn's engaging diagrams are also to be found in the
British Library's Gallery of Bodies as Machines,
www.bl.uk/learning/artimages/bodies/kahn/kahnmachines.html.)
There is more here than seems at first. For decades we have been
using the computing machine as our source of figurative language when
imagining ourselves, sometimes forgetting that the language is
figurative. Despite the trouble such forgetting causes as well as the
power computational metaphors have in helping us to understand our
21st-century selves, the situation isn't nearly as interesting seen
like that as when it is turned around. Ian Hacking has been working
for some time on doing so in one way, by working out the implications
of our becoming corporeally more and more artificial, as more and
more of our parts are replaced, repaired or supplemented for medical
or other reasons. John von Neumann did it another way when he turned
to neurological structures as a source of language to describe his
architecture for computing, in his famous "First Draft of a Report on
the EDVAC"
(<a href="http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/vonneumann-firstdraftedvac.pdf">http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/vonneumann-firstdraftedvac.pdf</a>).
This suggests that the important thing isn't so much the
computational metaphor for mind but the usefulness of the medium for
exploratory modelling of the neurobiology we do know.
There's also a long walk in the nearby forest, misty, darkish
mid-afternoon, with very black crows, Canadian geese and ducks who
are light enough to walk on the thin sheet of ice coating the ponds
here and there. Quietly beautiful in the southern English mode of
wintry beauty as we enjoy it these days. Headlamps and taillights of
the automobiles glimmer through the brush and bare branches of the
trees. A few walkers with us, several with their dogs, who are
anything but melancholy. Finally, too dark to navigate the deeper
parts of the forest, we return home to warmth, a chiming clock, food
and, thanks to my deep-sleeping computer, a guiltless evening of
non-academic pleasures.
Humanist now numbers 1600 subscribers, down one from earlier this
afternoon. Somebody must have left while I was out in the forest.
Farewell! To everyone who remains, my hope that Hanukkah was good,
that Eid is proceeding with much celebration, that Christmas will be
joyous and all the other festivals likewise.
Yours in early darkness,
WM

The Second Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data
(LaTeCH 2008) will be held in conjunction with LREC 2008, and will
take place on June 1 in Marrakech, Morocco.
* SCOPE AND TOPICS
Museums, archives, and libraries around the world maintain large
collections of cultural and scientific heritage objects, such as
archaeological artefacts, audio and video recordings, or manuscripts,
archival documents and other written sources. Such collections are a
potentially very valuable resource for specialists and laypersons
alike, provided they can be easily accessed and automatically
processed. Furthermore, textual cultural heritage resources, such as
old manuscripts and early printed books, are not only interesting for
their information content, but are also an invaluable source for
linguistic research on diachronic and synchronic language variety and
change. While several large scale digitisation projects are currently
underway to make cultural heritage resources more accessible, it is
equally important to develop powerful tools to search, link, enrich,
and mine the digitised data. Language technology has a crucial role to
play in this, even for collections which are primarily non-textual,
since text is the pervasive medium used for meta-data. At the same
time, the cultural heritage domain poses special challenges for the
NLP community, including the use of historic or non-standard language,
the presence of OCR or transcription errors in the data, and the
necessity to deal with data from various media.
For LaTeCH 2008, we invite papers on language technology for cultural
heritage data in general and on the special theme of "Studying
Language Variety and Change". Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to, the following:
     - enriching cultural heritage data by inducing meta-data
     - dealing with linguistic variation and non-standard or
       non-contemporary use of language
     - automatic error detection and cleaning
     - adapting existing NLP tools for the cultural heritage domain
     - linking and retrieving information from different sources, media,
       and languages
     - representing cultural heritage data to different audiences
       (personalisation, text simplification, text summarisation, text
       generation from databases, hypertext generation)
     - knowledge discovery in cultural heritage data
     - complex annotation tools
     - determination of word and sentence boundaries within manuscripts
     - resources for and treatment of dialects (general solutions)
     - annotations of language variety on the orthographic, morphological,
       and syntactic level
     - global language resource management systems
     - repositories of cultural and scientific heritage data

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 600 (600)

In Humanist 21.429, Andrew Brook wrote,
[deleted quotation]Let me take a run at a reply. I'd think that having an accurate,
informative history would only be of interest if it helped us, as he
says, to know what our current activities are like. An historian
might answer differently to other historians, but I'd think that if
he or she were talking to non-historians, then doing history would be
justified in terms similar to Andrew's. So the question is, why
should we go to so much trouble?
One answer would be to understand as much of what is at work in the
present as possible. If in any given historical moment there are many
latent possibilities, outcomes of what has happened and interactions
among those outcomes, then a history that shows the origins and
nature of these possibilities would help us to read them. Another
answer would be to show continuities obscured by misconceptions, e.g.
the ongoing philosophical problem that runs through the work of
Hilbert, Goedel and Turing to the present day, which overlooked
contributes to the false belief that computing is a purely technical
phenomenon of significance to us only instrumentally. I suppose one
could understand the situation by imagining a traveller who quite
suddenly suffers a case of total amnesia, and so has no idea why he
is carrying what he is carrying, what the items in his luggage are
for, where he was going, why &c. Borges has shown us that the
traveller with perfect recall and total knowledge may be in an even
worse fix, but since partial amnesia seems a condition of existence,
and forgetting more the real danger, we don't have to worry much
about overdoing it.
This is such a fascinating problem I'd think one could find many
schools of thought about it. But can we say, irrespective of school,
that in order to know the present (so that one can make well informed
decisions &c) one must know the past?
Andrew continues:
[deleted quotation]What *exactly* happened when chemistry replaced alchemy? Is
"replaced" the right word? I'd think that an historical response
would construe this lengthy and complex event as a type of what we
now call scientific progress, i.e. it would help us to understand the
idea of scientific progress. With that improved idea, we'd then
proceed to examine other instances, opening them up to see what was
gained (from our current perspective), what was lost. Kuhn's primary
source was the history of physics. What happens to his argument if we
look instead at the history of chemistry, or the history of biology
-- or the history of computing? Am I right in thinking that we have
been so profoundly influenced by the history of physics -- by the
notion that all sciences are reducible to physics, including (when we
can get around to it) the human sciences -- that basing our idea of
the fundamental science elsewhere constitutes a major meta-paradigm
shift? An even more radical meta-paradigm shift would perhaps result
if we ditched the notion of a fundamental science altogether for a
thorough-going relativism and, as I think Rorty has suggested, start
working seriously on our abilities to talk across disciplinary
discourses, collegially, as humanities computing is trying to do.

Subject: cognitive science like alchemy
Date: Sat, 29 Dec 2007 21:41:14 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 601 (601)

Dear Willard,
I'm not sure where the intriguing thread on the alchemy vs. chemistry
is going, but it's certainly provocative. It's one of those Ouroboric
epistemological questions.
As for history, it seems every generation of historians struggles
with itself and its predecessors over what history is and is for. But
like so much human activity, it seems to persist because it gives us
at least the promise of some sort of satisfaction, however fleeting.
In particular, I would welcome the satisfaction of a history of
alchemy that went beyond the perennially fashionable trope, "it was
hopelessly benighted and muddled, and then the Enlightenment happened
and Science began", etc. In particular, I would welcome such a true
history (if that is not a contradiction in terms) since it seems
clear to me that alchemy has hardly disappeared. On the contrary, it
is alive and thriving -- just check out the promises of personal and
financial transformation that clog your Inbox to see what I mean.
What's really fun about the Law of Attraction -- the notion that
since Like comes to Like, if you can only "think rich", you will
become so -- is that it's actually true, though not always in the
sense that the marketers are happy for you to take it. Buy the book
or just send them your credit card number, and someone gets rich even
if there is no shift in attitude: it's that magical. The
Philosopher's Stone takes the form of a DVD-ROM (or a correspondence
course or a login/pw), pregnant with fantastic power: but it's up to
you to figure out how to use it.
Yet on an even deeper level, it could be that the alchemists are
literally correct as well, and that yes, in fact, you can become rich
just by shifting your outlook and expectations. Of course, "rich" in
this literal sense might not mean "rich" in the monetary sense, etc.
So beneath the scam lurks an even more occult spiritual truth, albeit
one less satisfying to the materialist.
I mention all this since I want to draw attention to how the
transition from alchemy to chemistry was far more than one of light
out of darkness. While chemistry, founded on notions of disinterested
observation and scientific method, has succeeded beyond alchemy's
most outlandish hopes in mastering the physical universe, it has done
so by "denaturing" its parent, emptying alchemy of its ethical and
spiritual component. This is indeed both a gain, in that as the veils
of personal and emotional involvement are parted, we can at last
begin to see the world "as it is", and a loss, in that such a science
is perforce ethically neutral or even ethically void. There is
nothing unscientific about torturing animals or people, if it is done
in the pursuit of truth. But there may be something inhuman about it.
And consequently we now live in a world in which not only are animals
and human beings tortured in the name of "Science" or "Intelligence",
but also rationalism and the principle of reasoning from evidence
(rather than from hopes and fears and emotional commitments to fixed
ideas) have effectively banished themselves from ethical concerns
both large and small, as being somehow alien from and above them. And
then we are shocked and dismayed to see ethics and morality given
over to the most indulgent and undisciplined kind of magical thinking.
Isn't it interesting that while we are pondering the question of
whether, given advances in neurology, cognitive science will soon
have nothing to offer, the American Psychological Association is
riven by debate over the wisdom of a policy renouncing the
participation of professional psychologists in so-called "robust"
interrogation regimens, as currently practiced by agents of the US
Government and its proxies? Though only an amateur student of
cognitive science (and fascinated by its findings), like many I have
long been skeptical of its stronger claims that the mind can be
understood as a computer. (And I have been relieved to find that its
more thoughtful proponents have not supposed any such simple thing.)
This unease on my part has been motivated by two concerns. First, of
course, I found the analogy to be facile and unrevealing, given how
much it leaves out, even (or even especially) when the human brain
can be found to be performing something like computational
processing. But more important is the ethical concern: once we have
taken the step of considering the brain/body as a machine, it seems
too easy to consider human beings to be instruments to be manipulated
rather than as Others to be Regarded.
(Indeed, I am troubled even by regarding machines as "machines",
given that they too are part of the fabric of human experience, our
creations and evidently bound up in our fate, whatever it may be. How
can I understand the computer on which I type, or the car I drive, on
without seeing how embedded they are, and how they embed me in my use
of them, in the particular kind of human society they entail?)
In view of human purposes and aspirations, the shift from alchemy to
chemistry, or the shift from psychology to neurology (with cognitive
science as a way station), must be an incomplete one, if it leaves us
questioning not just what this is all for (this question being proper
enough), but whether there is any point in caring. Surely, if there
is anything that proves to have its end in itself, it is caring, or
Caritas. But such a recognition is only possible if we regard the
human subject (or any sentient subject, whatever form it takes) as a
reality rather than as a mere ghostly "epiphenomenon" to be
discounted (as if a phenomenon that is "emergent" must be less real
thereby). Thus, while I admire and promote chemistry, neurology and
indeed all the physical sciences, I do so not in the belief that they
represent the ultimate in knowledge, but rather in the hope and
intention that they be important steps along the way to a more
sympathetic, humane and complete outlook, which comprehends and
respects Nature and our place in it with more than a cold regard.
With best wishes for 2008,
Wendell

In "Brain as hardware, culture as software" (Inquiry 47.3, June 2004,
pp 219-35) -- read it tonight -- Richard Rorty writes,

[deleted quotation]Quite apart from the question of cognitive science and alchemy,
pursued here before Christmas, Rorty's summary of the Wittgensteinian
view of cognitive science raises for us a useful question. There can
now be no question that in humanities computing "very bright people
engage in spirited debates
with one another" and that after many years of hard work other
externals are in place (academic departments, professorships,
journals, awards etc). But are we disentangling ourselves from
history, computer science, English, musicology et al. "in the way
that chemistry did [from philosophy] -- by exhibiting [our] ability
to spin off new technologies" -- and other forms of knowledge?

CHANGING THE CHANGE: DESIGN VISIONS, PROPOSALS AND TOOLS
An international conference on the role and potential of design
research in the transition towards sustainability
Torino, Italy
<a href="http://www.changingthechange.org">http://www.changingthechange.org</a>

--
Organised by Co-ordination of Italian Design Research Doctorates
in cooperation with the
Conference of Italian Design Faculty Deans and Programme Heads
In the framework of WORLD DESIGN CAPITAL TORINO 2008
An ICSID initiative of the IDA
--
Endorsed by the Design Research Society
--
The conference "Changing the Change" seeks to make a significant
contribution to a necessary transformation that involves changing the
direction of current changes toward a sustainable future. It
specifically intends to outline the state-of-the-art of design
research in terms of visions, proposals and tools with which design
can actively and positively take part in the wider social learning
process that will have to take place. At the heart of the conference,
design researchers will present concrete and documentable research
results. This will be complemented by invited keynote speaker
presentations that will help paint a clearer picture of the common
ground from which the conference will take off.

AIMS
The conference seeks to make a significant contribution to the
twofold transformation underway. It specifically intends to outline
the state-of-the-art of design research in terms of vision, proposals
and tools with which design can actively and positively take part in
the wider social learning process that we refer to as "changing the
change." The conference has a double aim:
- to consolidate a design research culture and practice oriented
towards a constructive critical attitude able to reach all design
disciplines. The conference intends to focus on the way in which the
question of "changing the change" is present and widespread
throughout the research community and in relation to all design
fields: from product design to communication design; from interior
design to interaction, service and strategic design; from social
design to fashion design.
- to outline the state-of-the-art of contributions that design
research is today able to bring to social conversation about the
future. The conference seeks to bring visibility to significant
results. This with particular attention to visions of the future, to
feasible solutions and to tools to help bring them into being. It
will also enable us to make of the conference and its published
output a tool for communication with the outside world; a tool able
to demonstrate what design research can offer today to help
re-orientate the transformation underway.
In view of these aims, the conference will centre on the presentation
of research results that could make a positive contribution to
'changing the change'. It will welcome contributions that take as
their starting point transformations that have already taken place
and those underway, and the necessity to re-orient them towards more
sustainable outcomes. It hopes to present the widest range of
possible world visions, feasible proposals and the design tools that
could bring them into being.
--
THEMES
The field of interest of the conference is vast and will be divided
into various specific themes within which more precise, focused
discussion will be possible. This organisation into specific themes
will be undertaken after contributions have been selected, so as to
take into account what will actually be proposed. For the moment we
only indicate an initial, general division into the three themes
already introduced: visions, proposals and tools. Visions: this
section will present research results that lead us to imagine
possible worlds, or parts of possible worlds. It includes the results
of activities in the field of scenario design and more general
visions produced by research into specific products, communications
and services. It also includes a comparative analysis of visions
emerging from design history and from a comparison of different cultures.
Proposals: this section presents results of design research that give
rise to concrete solutions containing elements of systemic
innovation. They are also legible as concrete steps towards a new
generation of sustainable products, services and systems. So,
products, services and product and service systems are proposed along
with the communicative artefacts that link several actors and
artefacts together. It also proposes places for a new everyday life,
the activities that take place within them and the new production and
consumption networks that emerge from them. Tools: this section
presents the results of research that aims to redefine and develop
conceptual and operational tools which enable designers to operate
within change and influence its direction. Such tools enable them to
participate constructively in new design networks, and deal with
emerging problems. Tools may be proposed for conceptualisation and
representation, for calculation and appraisal of results or for
stimulation and prototype making.
--
AUDIENCE
The conference will mainly be a meeting point for academics,
researchers and research students in the field of design theory and
practice. However, in uniting a high academic level with the effort
to present concrete results of activities carried out, it will also
be of considerable interest to the wider design community and to
those economic and social operators who recognise the potential of
design practice and design research.

CALL FOR PAPERS
Abstracts should be between 500 and 700 words long, excluding the
bibliography. The deadline for the reception of abstracts is January
21, 2008. Reception of abstracts will be acknowledged and notices of
acceptance or rejection will be sent by March 3, 2008. The abstracts
will be evaluated and selected by a blind peer review process. Full
papers are limited to 6000 words. The deadline for full papers is on
May 26, 2008.
Selection criteria
The abstracts will be evaluated and selected by a blind peer review
process. Coherently with the conference aims, the Peer Review
Committee will base its decisions on three major criteria: (1)
relevance to the topics of "Changing the change"? as outlined below
and in the website, (2) focalisation, in terms of clarity of the
vision, of the proposal or the design tool and theory they present,
and (3) reliability, in terms of the quality of the design research
on which the paper is based.
More precisely:
- abstracts must be clearly defined as visions, proposals or design
tools and theories (please select the proper option at the head of
the abstract template and delete the others) : visions refer to
scenarios of possible worlds, or parts of possible worlds; proposals
present specific solutions to specific problems; tools and theories
introduce conceptual and operational devices enabling designers to
operate in contemporary contexts.
- abstracts must clearly refer to the contemporary context and to its
on-going transformations (considering the different ways they are
taking place in different regions of the world). In this framework,
they should present design research results that, moving from a deep
understanding of these transformations, propose a design contribution
involving a re-orientation towards more sustainable directions.
- abstracts must present design research results and clearly indicate
the specific research programme they are based on (with its aims,
methodology and main actors). Given these three pre-requisites,
abstracts (and the papers that will follow) can deal with any topics
in any design fields: from product to communication; from interior to
interaction; from service to strategy; from social design to fashion.
--
CALL FOR VISUALISATIONS
Special consideration will be dedicated to abstracts/papers
presenting design research projects with highly communicative visual results.
Therefore, together with the abstract/paper, a visualisation can be
submitted as material for an exhibition that will be organized
parallel to the Conference.
The visualisations do not substitute the papers. To be accepted for
evaluation they have to refer to a paper that has to be selected by
the Peer review Committee.
The conference will host an exhibition based on the visualisations
proposed by selected papers. These visualisations are not the
traditional scientific posters. They are visual presentations of
design research results. They have to show visions of possible worlds
and proposals for sustainable solutions. Whoever intends to deliver a
visualisation must submit a first draft together with the abstract of
the paper presenting the research on which the visualization is
based. (Deadline: January 21, 2008)
--
PUBLICATIONS
All selected and presented papers will be published on line, and
placed in the conference website in printable form.
A special peer review jury will adjudicate the best papers
submitted. The best papers and the presentations of the keynote
speakers will be published in book form.

Computing at McGill
McGill University seeks a postdoctoral fellow to
join a large, international, interdisciplinary
research project, "Making Publics: Media,
Markets, and Association in Early Modern Europe,
1500-1700." The "MaPs" project is developing a
transformative account of the cultural and social
life of Europe from 1500 to 1700. Members of the
team, from Canada, the USA, and Europe, include
scholars in Art, Literature, Music, Theatre
History, History of Science, History of Religion,
Sociology, Human Geography, Media Studies, Social
and Intellectual History, and Education. At the
heart of the work is the study of the creation of
small-scale forms of association that represented
a new way of connecting with others, a kind of
connection not founded in family, rank or
vocation, but rather a form of voluntary
community built on the shared interests, tastes,
and desires of individuals. The central research
questions of the project -- how did public-making
change early modern society? how did it
contribute to the emergence of modernity? how
does public-making change the way we understand
the social and political dimensions of artistic
and intellectual works? -- are crystallizing into a
substantially new way of understanding early modernity and modernity itself.
Please visit the project website for further
information on the project and members of the
research team: <a href="http://makingpublics.mcgill.ca">http://makingpublics.mcgill.ca</a>.
The start date for the year-long position is July
1, 2008. There is the possibility of renewal.
Candidates will have a PhD in one of the fields
relevant to the project and a research program
that connects substantially with MaPs. It is
expected that part of the Fellow's research
program will have to do with the educational and
social dimensions of web-based resources in the
Humanities. The Fellow will work closely with
colleagues in an interdisciplinary context. With
help and guidance from team members Wes Folkerth
and Kevin Kee, the Fellow will be principally
responsible for the continued maintenance and
development of the project website. The
fellowship will be approximately $30,000 CAD per
annum. Applications, consisting of a description
of research program, writing sample, CV, plus
three letters of recommendation, must be sent by
regular post by December 15, 2007 to Paul
Yachnin, Tomlinson Professor of Shakespeare
Studies, Department of English, Arts Building,
McGill University, 853 Sherbrooke Street West.,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H3A 2T5.

Dear colleagues,
The deluge of Humanist last evening (GMT) has no doubt alerted you to
the error in my prediction that Humanist would remain silent until
2008. I made every effort to comb through the listing of messages
sent to Virginia for processing and managed to rescue a number of
them -- but perhaps not all. Because the problem occurred at that
stage of processing, the issue numbers don't reveal whether anything
remains undiscovered. So, if you haven't seen your posting as yet,
assume it has gone forever and resend, please.
Humanist won't go voluntarily silent for New Year's, since it is my
custom not to celebrate the turnover of the year, though I cannot
promise to behave in a completely exemplary manner when the time
comes. To keep me on the relatively straight and reasonably narrow,
please do not interrupt your flow of postings.
All the best to everyone in the new year.
Yours,
WM

Friends,
The current issue of the International Journal of
Design was released yesterday.
The International Journal of Design is a
peer-reviewed, open-access journal devoted to
publishing research papers in all fields of
design, including industrial design, visual
communication design, interface design, animation
and game design, architectural design, urban
design, and other design related fields. It aims
to provide an international forum for the
exchange of ideas and findings from researchers
across different cultures and encourages research
on the impact of cultural factors on design
theory and practice. It also seeks to promote the
transfer of knowledge between professionals in
academia and industry by emphasizing research in
which results are of interest or applicable to design practices.
The editors are now seeking papers for a special
issue on Cultural Aspects of Interaction Design.
The special issue editors are Prof. Keiichi Sato
of the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute
of Technology and Prof. Kuohsiang Chen of the
Department and Institute of Industrial Design at
National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan.
The deadline is February 28, 2008.

Subject: 2008:  Predictions, Hopes and Fears
Date: Wed, 02 Jan 2008 07:17:17 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 615 (615)

Every year I write my predictions, hopes and fears, but this year
I think we can all agree that these predictions cross boundaries,
concern advances, and declines, in both the technology and social
world orders that are far beyond anything I previously predicted.
This year's predictions include "personal libraries" on "personal
computers" to rival the largest libraries in the world; USB 3.0--
which will reduce overnight data copying and backups to ONE HOUR;
and very inexpensive terabyte drives.
Prediction #1:  The "Personal Computer" as "Personal Library"
Prediction #2:  USB 3.0 Will Change The World of Copies/Backups
Prediction #3:  USB 3.0 Terabyte Drives Will Do More Than. . . .
Prediction #4:  Is "The Digital Divide" Half Empty Or Half Full?
Prediction #5:  Rethinking "The Digital Divide". . .More or Less
The World's Largest Libraries, Will eLibraries Be Counted?
Prediction #1:  The "Personal Computer" as "Personal Library"
In 2008, someone will create their own private "personal computer
personal library" so large as to hold enough books to enter lists
of the world's 100 largest libraries based on total books.
As many of you know, I have been doing research on these "World's
Largest Libraries" for a couple months, concentrating mostly on a
total number of books held by such libraries.
When I started this research, it was to write up some feasibility
study parameters on building electronic libraries the same size.
This was prompted by the advent of the new terabyte drives we are
seeing on the market at very inexpensive prices.  [More Below]
The latest statistics I could find, officially being published in
the upcoming new edition of "Library World Records," indicate The
Library Of Congress is still the world's largest library with the
grand total of around 32.5 million books, with several other huge
libraries closer than one might think, in China and Russia.
32.5 million books.
Sounds like a lot.
Let's break that down into these new modern day terabyte drives--
these contain a trillion characters and are under $200 or e100.
A million books of a million characters = 1 trillion characters.
Each terabyte drive can hold a million books.
2.5+ million if you use any of the various compression programs,
and these are so good today, that there is really never any need
to actually uncompress the files to read them, sometimes even to
edit them. . .it's all done very transparently.
2.5 million books times 13 equals 32.5 million books.
13 terabytes to hold the entire Library Of Congress.
$3,000 bought my first 5 megabyte hard drive in 1979.
$3,000 today will buy you the average computer sold and add that
13 terabytes. . .NOT EVEN ACCOUNTING FOR INFLATION!!!
USB 3.0 Is Coming in 2008
Prediction #2:  USB 3.0 Will Change The World of Copies/Backups
USB 3.0 will change how we view drives, backups, deletions and a
host of other similar topics.
Starting in 2008 backups and copies that used to take from 10 PM
to 8 AM will be so fast you can do them over your lunch break.
10 times faster.
The utility of outboard USB drives, USB flash drives, etc., will
pass a breakthrough point at which the general public will think
nothing of making backups, and we will have heard the last of an
assortment of complaints of lost data from Nobel Prize laureates
who just never got around to backing up their data.
You think I am joking?  I don't want to name names, but a plenty
large sample of such took place right here in Illinois, at local
universities where I used to hang out.
The "Big Change" will be how simply and easily entire libraries,
12 gigabytes worth, at 2,500 books per gigabyte, for the ~30,000
books in the average U.S. Public Library, will change hands in a
literal minute or two with USB 3.0 being 10 times faster.
Terabyte Drives Will Become Totally Portable in 2008
Prediction #3:  USB 3.0 Terabyte Drives Will Do More Than. . . .
The addition of USB 3.0 to terabyte drives means one hour copies
of entire terabyte drives.
No one thought about the portability of terabytes before, simply
because the TIME involved was too great even if the WEIGHT of an
average terabyte had fallen to briefcase proportions.
However, at ONE HOUR copying time, you can now meet someone from
another location and copy an entire terabyte during lunch hour.
Try sending a terabyte over the Internet, just for comparison.
Or even over your local network.
Your network gurus will likely be all over you.
The result is a freedom from the networks.
Worst case scenario, you SEND the terabyte drive a thousand mile
journey for the person to copy. . .or just let them keep it, and
have them send you something else back later.
There should be some opportunities for VERY inexpensive purchase
of USB 2 drives and accessories, for those who don't need speed,
but just want LOTS of terabytes.
The combination of USB 3.0 and terabyte drives will provide some
unexpected synergy and change the drive world.
Unexpected for those who do not think ahead.
You will see more and more drives carried from place to place.
Offsite backups will finally become a real reality.
As they should have been years and decades ago, and nearly were.
But that's another story.
Will "The Digital Divide" Rear It's Ugly Head?  Again, Already?
Prediction #4:  Is "The Digital Divide" Half Empty Or Half Full?
Given that there are well over 1 billion people on the Internet,
and given that there are now at least 3 billion with cellphones,
it appears that either side of "The Digital Divide" could claim,
as legitimately as the other, that they are the larger, smaller,
or whatever side they want to claim.
The FACT is that of all the people in the world who WANT to link
up via the Internet or cellphone, that it can no longer be said,
with any degree of truth, that most people are without access.
And it's not going to stop at 4 billion or even 5 billion, but 6
billion electronically connected people is a possibility in just
a few more years.
Given this kind of "market saturation" the only alternative from
the corporate point of view will be to finally unleash all those
"unsupported features" that have been lurking in cellphones.
"Unsupported Features???"
Oh, didn't they tell you???
There are perhaps twice as many features IN your cellphones as a
person is told are there, many of which are kept out of reach in
some kind of hardware manner, others are hidden via software.
This means that "hackers" will soon reappear on the scene to add
in the features your cellphone providers either "forgot" to tell
you about, or actually intentionally disabled to keep you out of
some other market for which they wanted to charge higher rates.
No kidding, the average cellphone out there might have dozens of
"new" features you haven't heard about, but that were there, all
the time, ever since it was manufactured.
Why?
Up to now the world cellphone market was never 50% saturated.
That meant the companies could still dream market doubling.
Now they can't.
Why?
Remember "The Dot Com Bust?"
That happened because the entire American computer industry were
unable to consider the FACT that they had saturated half of what
was their entire potential market.
They had doubled their market time after time after time, etc.
They would NEVER be able to double their market again once those
saturation levels hit 50%.
Sounds simple, eh?
We had this stuff in math class in grade school.
How many times can something double.
Right up to just ONE doubling from saturation.
Duh!
And all the "Dot Com Billionaires" never figured this out. . . .
This time they will. . .at least I hope so, or else cellphone as
we know it. . .could go through the same agonizing reappraisal.
So, the essence of this prediction is twofold:
First, get used to the idea the average world citizen has access.
Second, better get used to cellphone companies giving more to the
customers, or they will lose market share to competitors.
Steve Jobs figured this out.
That's why he created the iPhone.
Steve Jobs is NOT your average "Dot Com for Dummies" kinda guy.
Prediction #5:  Rethinking "The Digital Divide". . .More or Less
2008 is going to see a vast reappraisal of digital services.
For some the "agonizing reappraisal" quotation will come to mind
as they remember other times their beliefs conflicted with quite
literal actual realities.
The social engineering departments of various institutions, many
of them libraries, have been considering limiting access to what
services they can based on proof of local residency, i.e. living
in the tax base supporting the particular institution.
Given that this is a social engineering issue and not technical,
at least not in the sense of the technologies mentioned earlier,
this section will simply predict the issue, not the outcome as I
have learned that social engineering often flies in the faces of
the more technical aspects.
However, one way or another, "The Digital Divide" has changed to
being over half full, rather than over half empty.
Some people resist that kind of change.
Those people want to preserve the previous boundaries.
The political policies may be obvious; they simply won't provide
services to those they want to keep ignorant and illiterate.
2008 may be remembered as the year the conservative world made a
conscious decision to cut off services to the masses, to provide
their various services, library and others, ONLY to those proven
to be legitimate residential members of their financial base.
I don't really know what is going to happen here, but watching a
movement of this nature should be very enlightening.
Thanks!!!

Subject: RE: 21.453 disentanglement
Date: Tue, 08 Jan 2008 13:54:52 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 617 (617)

Stephen Ramsay (as I understand him) said "amen" to the passage
quoted from Rorty's 2004 article, and I -- nudged over the line by
Willard's earlier request for comments -- now say amen to Stephen's
characterization of "the disentangling" as "a great danger". And
I'd say that the danger lies not in any ultimate success which that
attempt to disentangle, as envisaged by Willard, may have. For to
my mind, the attempt is futile. The danger is one of much wasted
(or, at best, misdirected) effort, of misunderstandings, frustration
and probably disillusionment attendant upon trying to wind up
somewhere other than where we (as humanists =FCberhaupt) should
be wanting to go.
Perhaps this is more readily apparent to me because many practitoners
within my own current (after earlier stints in humanities teaching and
research, then in publishing) field, that of academic library/information
work, operate under a quite similar misconception regarding that field's
intellectual place in the world. (And its proper destiny, I dare say.)

** The NEH Announces Two New Digital Humanities Programs at CNI **
At the recent Fall 2007 CNI Task Force Meeting here in Washington, DC, I
announced two new digital humanities grant programs. They are:
1) Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities
These grants are for institutes, workshops, or other training events in
the digital humanities. The guidelines are out now and the deadline is
April 9, 2008. See:
<a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/IATDH.html">http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/IATDH.html</a>
2) NEH Fellowships at Digital Humanities Centers
This new program in our Division of Research will allow digital
humanities centers to receive a grant to host a fellow in residence. The
guidelines won't be out until February 2008 or so. But I have posted a
one-page information sheet at:

Date: Tue, 08 Jan 2008 13:53:50 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 619 (619)

SECOND CALL -- Apologies for cross posting
Christian Wittern, who has served so ably as TEI Council Chair since
2003 stepped down at the end of his third term on December
31st, 2007.
To assist it in its deliberations, the TEI Board is seeking nominations
(including self-nominations) for candidates to replace Professor Wittern
in this important post. Nominees need not be members of the TEI, its
Board, or Council. The successful candidate will be appointed to both
the Board and Council for an initial term of two years. As an officer of
the Consortium, the Council Chair is not remunerated. The Council is
assigned a significant budget for travel and other costs including
technical support and editorial assistance, however.
The Council Chair is responsible for directing the activities of the
Council and its workgroups. This involves maintaining and developing the
Guidelines and proposing and assisting in the development of training
documents and tutorials, technical services, and collaborations between
the TEI and other organisations. In keeping with the emphasis of the
2007 Members' Meeting, the board is particularly interested in
candidates who share the Board's interest in improving the Consortium's
work on outreach, education, and collaboration.
The Board intends to appoint a replacement for Professor Wittern within
the next six weeks. Nominations should be directed to the Executive
Secretary, Chris Ruotolo (ruotolo_at_virginia.edu), no later than 1200 UTC
on January 11, 2008.
For further information, please feel free to contact the Consortium
Chair, Daniel Paul O'Donnell (daniel.odonnell_at_uleth.ca) or any member of
the Consortium Board (see <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/About/board.xml">http://www.tei-c.org/About/board.xml</a> for a
list with contact addresses).

[deleted quotation]Since _Humanist_ was in a sort of hibernation over the holidays
( out of which it still has to come ? ), I'll go ahead now and
comment, on the posting below, that the points you are making
are to my mind excellent and very much on-track, and,
furthermore, ones we should also *pragmatically* take very
much to heart. ( But how do we, at least collectively, go about
that ?  -- *that's* always been the hard part. )
What you are in fact advocating is a "histoire du pr=E9sent" as
conceived by Foucault (very much like what he also described
as a "g=E9n=E9alogie").
Indeed maybe Rorty's "conversation" is a help in getting such
a process started.
But in the meantime, perhaps thinking in terms of consciously and
fully exploiting what Star and Griesemer dubbed "boundary objects"
would already amount to a significant improvement.
Getting *that* act together is going to be hard enough, but still a
piece of cake, in my opinion, when compared to a really effective,
collectively legitimated "histoire du pr=E9sent" (which may ultimately be
a human impossibility -- but that *doesn't* mean we shouldn't be
constantly mindful that we don't yet have one, and act accordingly).
The above shouldn't be taken to apply specifically (or necessarily)
to cross-disciplinary affairs where one of those disciplines is
humanities computing -- since I'm, as I indicated in an earlier
contribution, not convinced just what a proper disciplinary place
for humanities computing ought to look like.

SEARCHABLE VIDEO LECTURES
This fall researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
released the MIT Lecture Browser, "a web interface to video recordings
of lectures and seminars that have been indexed using automatic speech
recognition technology." Users can search on terms or phrases and then
play the video at the point(s) in the recording where their search term
appears.
This technology first involved creating software that converted audio
to text. Next the software was trained "to understand particular
accents using accurate transcriptions of short snippets of recorded
speech." Then the researchers provided data on uncommon words so the
software could recognize technical terms that might be used in
university lectures.
While the transcript's accuracy can be affected by speakers' verbal
pauses or by nonnative English speakers' accents, the texts can be very
close to the audio originals. The transcripts' accuracy is sufficient
for searches, and there is potential for use by hearing-impaired
students if future plans to allow users to make corrections to
transcripts are implemented.

ONLINE GROUP LEARNING PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
"Online group learning . . . if implemented appropriately, can provide
an ideal environment in which interaction among students plays a
central role in the learning process . . . . Why then is online group
learning not more widely practiced, particularly within higher
education?"
In "Seven Problems of Online Group Learning (and Their Solutions)"
(JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY, vol. 10, no. 4, 2007, pp.
257-268). Tim S. Roberts and Joanne M. McInnerney describe
frequently-voiced justifications that instructors use for avoiding
online group learning activities. The authors suggest several
techniques for successfully solving such problems as:
-- student antipathy towards group work
-- a lack of essential group-work skills
-- possible inequalities of student abilities
-- the assessment of individuals within the groups.

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 624 (624)

Brown University
The Scholarly Technology Group at Brown is looking for the right
person to complete our team.
We're looking for a creative, technically sophisticated individual
who will use computer methods and structured data to augment the
resarch process for humanities scholars. We're not an acronym-based
technical services shop; we are part of the university research
environment, with a license to explore content and technology, and
push the boundaries of practice where possible. If you're not
interested in digitality or the humanities, you're probably not a
good fit.
As a senior technical member of the team, you will have the
opportunity to explore and to lead, in a unique academic environment.
An increased, university-wide, focus on the digital humanities and
digital libraries make this an especially exciting moment to join
STG. The Senior Research Programmer will be a technical contributor
and a partner in defining and implementing technology in humanities
research agendas at Brown.
While this is not an academic position, STG has close relationships
with the academic part of the university, and can arrange
departmental affiliations for an appropriate candidate.
This position requires breadth of vision and experience across
significant and disparate fields. No candidate can be equally deep in
all areas, so we are not limited by formal credentials in any
specific area; we are  looking for a candidate who can excel in an
interdisciplinary environment. You will thrive here if you can
communicate and think across the gap between Snow's "two cultures."
We will also consider interested applicants without a formal
humanities background. Applicants with a degree in Library Science,
Information Science, or Computer Science and an interest in the kinds
of problems involved in digital humanities projects and data are
encouraged to apply.
Senior Research Programmer - Humanities
Scholarly Technology Group
Brown University
The Scholarly Technology Group (STG) at Brown University is seeking a
senior staff member who will provide technical leadership and
innovation as part of STG's involvement in, and engagement with,
faculty research projects in the digital humanities. STG projects
range from document databases based on XML and XML tools, to
experiments in collaboration, classification, mapping and
visualization. STG projects are founded in high-level information
design, and require current knowledge of web standards and
interaction design. The Senior Research Programmer is encouraged to
have a relevant research agenda of their own, or to participate in
the group's ongoing research into digital humanities topics.
STG staff provide faculty projects with expertise in text encoding
and metadata standards, accessibility, database design, web
programming, digital project design, information design, and grant-
writing. We combine a strong background in the humanities and social
sciences with a deep interest in the meaning of digital technologies
for scholarly communication.
The Senior Research Programmer works closely with faculty, STG staff
and students to carry out digital humanities projects by performing
project analysis, providing technical leadership, system architecture
and programming and software development.  Since STG is a small
group, this person can contribute at all levels: to recruit, plan,
manage projects, write grant proposals, stay abreast of new methods
and technologies and disseminate STG's work at conferences.
Qualifications:
* Minimum Bachelor's degree, advanced degree in the humanities
desirable. Formal CS coursework or equivalent.
* Experience in digital humanities, digital libraries or comparable
area.
* Strong technical background in relevant areas, ideally: XML, web
technologies, metadata standards, text retrieval, software development
* Interest in digital communications and collaboration, new media.
* Strong analytical and problem solving skills; can formulate
options, develop and recommend solutions, especially in a constantly
changing work environment.
* Ability to communicate STG ideas and results within the group and
externally.
STG is part of Computing and Information Services and provides
advanced technology consulting to Brown humanities faculty primarily
through large and small projects in support of scholarly work in the
digital medium. We explore, extend anc contribute to the critical new
technologies that are transforming scholarly work and helping to
maintain its longevity: data and metadata standards, XML publication
tools, text encoding methods, database design, and accessibility
standards. We have a strong relationship with the Brown University
Library's Center for Digital Initiatives, and often work on joint
projects. STG consists of three staff members: the Director, a Senior
Research Programmer, and a Research Programmer. STG also employs
several student programmers and designers and works with graduate
students who provide content expertise.

ools_for_Building_Projects%29
(or navigate: <a href="http://wiki.english.ucsb.edu">http://wiki.english.ucsb.edu</a> > Technology Resources > Toy
Chest)
"Toy Chest" collects online or downloadable software tools/thinking toys
that humanities students and others without programming skills (but with
basic computer and Internet literacy) can use to create interesting
projects. Most of the tools gathered here are free or relatively inexpensive
(exceptions: items that are expensive but can be used productively on a free
trial basis). Also on this page are "paradigms"--books, essays, digital
projects, etc.--that illustrate the kinds of humanities projects that
software thinking tools/toys might help create."  Each entry includes a
descriptive annotation, screenshot, and link.  Included at present are tools
for diagramming, game creation, mapping, mashup creation, simulation &
modeling, text analysis, visualization/pattern-discovery, and machinima.
RATIONALE: Because digital networked technology is now used across the board
by the sciences and engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities and
arts, it increasingly prompts different disciplines to rethink their own
dominant research/knowledge paradigms in light of other disciplines.  (My
favorite anecdote: a computer scientist on my campus, broad minded and
honest, who, upon hearing a fine literary interpretation of a poem during a
planning meeting for a collaborative project, paused reflectively and asked:
"What's that for?"  At which point, my social-science colleague piled on:
"That's item one.  Where are the other thousand samples needed for a valid
study?"  I remember the hush in the room, as the "ships passed in the
night.")
          Meanwhile, digital networked technology has rapidly developed in the
directions of so-called "Web services" and "Web 2.0" so as increasingly to
enable non-programmers to use sophisticated software tools in
visual-programming and other low-learning-curve styles to create
conceptually interesting projects (e.g., "mashup"-creation platforms like
Yahoo Pipes and Microsoft Popfly, simulation platforms like Netlogo,
interactive animation platforms like Scratch, machinima platforms like
Moviestorm).  (And this is not even to mention blog-engines and wikis that
simplify the creation of database-to-web resources adaptable to any number
of outputs--e.g., archives, editions, museums, epistolary novels, etc.)
          Also, at the same time, humanities and digital humanities scholars
such as Julia Flanders (on text encoding and quantitative imagination),
Matthew Kirschenbaum (on digital forensics and "formal materiality"),
Willard McCarty (on modeling), Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels (on
deformance), Franco Moretti (on "distance reading" and _Graphs, Maps,
Trees_), Rita Raley (on codework), Stephen Ramsay (on algorithmic
criticism), Geoffrey Rockwell (on textual analysis), and many others have
been creating the theory for crossing between such established humanistic
research paradigms as "interpretation" and alternative knowledge paradigms.
          I created my Toy Chest to harvest the confluence of the above three
trends.  The Toy Chest is designed specifically to support a suite of
undergraduate and graduate courses that I am teaching next quarter (after a
pilot course last year) entitled "Literature+"  In these courses, the
students are required to choose a literary work and do something with it for
a project that is anything other than literary interpretation. ("Students,
for example, can choose a story or poem to model, simulate, map, visualize,
encode, text-analyze, sample, storyboard, blog, or redesign as a game,
database, hypertext, or virtual world. What are the strengths and weaknesses
of literary interpretation, close reading, or theory by comparison with
other research methods?"):

<a href="http://english236-w2008.pbwiki.com/">http://english236-w2008.pbwiki.com/</a>
HELP!: Please post to Humanist any suggestions you have for online or
downloadable (free, cheap, or usable on a trial-basis) project-creation
tools that might be added to the Toy Chest.
SUGGESTION FOR THE FUTURE: I am keeping this Toy Chest on my department's
knowledge-base wiki, so it is not directly editable by members of this list.
I wonder if it would be possible for Willard--as both the genius loci of
Humanist and one of the chief theorists of the trends that the the Toy Chest
represents--to investigate setting up a wiki for this purpose that would be
open (upon Willard's approval) to members of Humanist at large?  I think we
could use a central repository of "digital humanities tools usable by the
ordinary student."

CHANGING THE CHANGE: DESIGN VISIONS, PROPOSALS AND TOOLS
An international conference on the role and potential of design
research in the transition towards sustainability
Torino, Italy
<a href="http://www.changingthechange.org">http://www.changingthechange.org</a>

--
Organised by Co-ordination of Italian Design Research Doctorates
in cooperation with the
Conference of Italian Design Faculty Deans and Programme Heads
In the framework of WORLD DESIGN CAPITAL TORINO 2008
An ICSID initiative of the IDA
--
Endorsed by the Design Research Society
--
The conference "Changing the Change" seeks to make a significant
contribution to a necessary transformation that involves changing the
direction of current changes toward a sustainable future. It
specifically intends to outline the state-of-the-art of design
research in terms of visions, proposals and tools with which design
can actively and positively take part in the wider social learning
process that will have to take place. At the heart of the conference,
design researchers will present concrete and documentable research
results. This will be complemented by invited keynote speaker
presentations that will help paint a clearer picture of the common
ground from which the conference will take off.
--
AIMS
The conference seeks to make a significant contribution to the
twofold transformation underway. It specifically intends to outline
the state-of-the-art of design research in terms of vision, proposals
and tools with which design can actively and positively take part in
the wider social learning process that we refer to as "changing the
change." The conference has a double aim:
- to consolidate a design research culture and practice oriented
towards a constructive critical attitude able to reach all design
disciplines. The conference intends to focus on the way in which the
question of "changing the change" is present and widespread
throughout the research community and in relation to all design
fields: from product design to communication design; from interior
design to interaction, service and strategic design; from social
design to fashion design.
- to outline the state-of-the-art of contributions that design
research is today able to bring to social conversation about the
future. The conference seeks to bring visibility to significant
results. This with particular attention to visions of the future, to
feasible solutions and to tools to help bring them into being. It
will also enable us to make of the conference and its published
output a tool for communication with the outside world; a tool able
to demonstrate what design research can offer today to help
re-orientate the transformation underway.
In view of these aims, the conference will centre on the presentation
of research results that could make a positive contribution to
'changing the change'. It will welcome contributions that take as
their starting point transformations that have already taken place
and those underway, and the necessity to re-orient them towards more
sustainable outcomes. It hopes to present the widest range of
possible world visions, feasible proposals and the design tools that
could bring them into being.
--
THEMES
The field of interest of the conference is vast and will be divided
into various specific themes within which more precise, focused
discussion will be possible. This organisation into specific themes
will be undertaken after contributions have been selected, so as to
take into account what will actually be proposed. For the moment we
only indicate an initial, general division into the three themes
already introduced: visions, proposals and tools. Visions: this
section will present research results that lead us to imagine
possible worlds, or parts of possible worlds. It includes the results
of activities in the field of scenario design and more general
visions produced by research into specific products, communications
and services. It also includes a comparative analysis of visions
emerging from design history and from a comparison of different cultures.
Proposals: this section presents results of design research that give
rise to concrete solutions containing elements of systemic
innovation. They are also legible as concrete steps towards a new
generation of sustainable products, services and systems. So,
products, services and product and service systems are proposed along
with the communicative artefacts that link several actors and
artefacts together. It also proposes places for a new everyday life,
the activities that take place within them and the new production and
consumption networks that emerge from them. Tools: this section
presents the results of research that aims to redefine and develop
conceptual and operational tools which enable designers to operate
within change and influence its direction. Such tools enable them to
participate constructively in new design networks, and deal with
emerging problems. Tools may be proposed for conceptualisation and
representation, for calculation and appraisal of results or for
stimulation and prototype making.
--
AUDIENCE
The conference will mainly be a meeting point for academics,
researchers and research students in the field of design theory and
practice. However, in uniting a high academic level with the effort
to present concrete results of activities carried out, it will also
be of considerable interest to the wider design community and to
those economic and social operators who recognise the potential of
design practice and design research.
--
CALL FOR PAPERS
Abstracts should be between 500 and 700 words long, excluding the
bibliography. The deadline for the reception of abstracts is January
21, 2008. Reception of abstracts will be acknowledged and notices of
acceptance or rejection will be sent by March 3, 2008. The abstracts
will be evaluated and selected by a blind peer review process. Full
papers are limited to 6000 words. The deadline for full papers is on
May 26, 2008.
Selection criteria
The abstracts will be evaluated and selected by a blind peer review
process. Coherently with the conference aims, the Peer Review
Committee will base its decisions on three major criteria: (1)
relevance to the topics of "Changing the change"? as outlined below
and in the website, (2) focalisation, in terms of clarity of the
vision, of the proposal or the design tool and theory they present,
and (3) reliability, in terms of the quality of the design research
on which the paper is based.
More precisely:
- abstracts must be clearly defined as visions, proposals or design
tools and theories (please select the proper option at the head of
the abstract template and delete the others) : visions refer to
scenarios of possible worlds, or parts of possible worlds; proposals
present specific solutions to specific problems; tools and theories
introduce conceptual and operational devices enabling designers to
operate in contemporary contexts.
- abstracts must clearly refer to the contemporary context and to its
on-going transformations (considering the different ways they are
taking place in different regions of the world). In this framework,
they should present design research results that, moving from a deep
understanding of these transformations, propose a design contribution
involving a re-orientation towards more sustainable directions.
- abstracts must present design research results and clearly indicate
the specific research programme they are based on (with its aims,
methodology and main actors). Given these three pre-requisites,
abstracts (and the papers that will follow) can deal with any topics
in any design fields: from product to communication; from interior to
interaction; from service to strategy; from social design to fashion.
--
CALL FOR VISUALISATIONS
Special consideration will be dedicated to abstracts/papers
presenting design research projects with highly communicative visual results.
Therefore, together with the abstract/paper, a visualisation can be
submitted as material for an exhibition that will be organized
parallel to the Conference.
The visualisations do not substitute the papers. To be accepted for
evaluation they have to refer to a paper that has to be selected by
the Peer review Committee.
The conference will host an exhibition based on the visualisations
proposed by selected papers. These visualisations are not the
traditional scientific posters. They are visual presentations of
design research results. They have to show visions of possible worlds
and proposals for sustainable solutions. Whoever intends to deliver a
visualisation must submit a first draft together with the abstract of
the paper presenting the research on which the visualization is
based. (Deadline: January 21, 2008)
--
PUBLICATIONS
All selected and presented papers will be published on line, and
placed in the conference website in printable form.
A special peer review jury will adjudicate the best papers
submitted. The best papers and the presentations of the keynote
speakers will be published in book form.

Colleagues,
Please forward this announcement to interested faculty and staff:
In recent years, plagiarism and cheating have been highlighted in the
news.  Whether discussing high-profile cases like Stephen Ambrose and
Doris Kearns Godwin or reviewing works on the subject by notables like
Judge Richard Posner, the public appears keenly interested in
plagiarism.   Plagiarism detection devices, once all the rage are, with
greater intensity, being challenged legally and ethically as
inappropriate vehicles for detecting plagiarism. Most recently,
Turnitin.com is in the middle of litigation challenging its business
practices as violations of copyright law.
Please join the Center for Intellectual Property as we attempt to
address the plagiarism and cheating issues on college campuses and try
to build communities that value academic integrity.

Studies show that establishing a community of shared academic values
fosters academic integrity in the classroom. However, establishing that
community may be more difficult when students adopt the values of a
digital "remix" culture that challenges the traditional understanding of
authorship. How do institutions foster academic integrity values in
light of changing cultural norms? Are there special techniques and tools
required? Are the best tools to use in preventing academic dishonesty
"technical" like Turnitin.com? And are there additional legal and
ethical issues involved when using technical measures to prevent
academic dishonesty? Please see site for detailed course objectives-

Readers of Humanist will undoubtedly be interested in Lisa Spiro's
"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities" blog -- both in general, and
for her extremely thoughtful and well researched "year in review," now
in its second of thee parts.
Lisa has has been a member of the DH community for many years, and
brings the perspective of a literary scholar and a digital librarian
to the discussion.
I really wish she was writing my annual reports.

Thank you for the welcome message and hello to the List!  I've
recently received my doctorate in the Humanities from the University
of Texas at Dallas after designing and selling standby industrial
power systems in the international markets for twenty years.  I did
my dissertation on the assessment of visual rhetoric, and I am
especially interested in the response of the rhetoric/composition
field to the natural language applications that have made possible
machine reading of student essays.  I am an Assistant Professor of
English at Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida, and I am
looking forward to reading the posts/concerns from this list.
Best to all,

Subject: call for papers: Learning Inquiry
Date: Mon, 14 Jan 2008 06:26:10 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 639 (639)

Dear Colleagues;
As Learning Inquiry starts it second year of publication we are
sending out a call for participation in our ongoing attempt to create
a transdiciplinary forum to engage the widest variety of perspectives
on learning. We're looking for articles and special issues that push
the boundaries and include new perspectives, but also take the
opportunity to share research and experiences from particular
locations of inquiry to a larger audience.
Learning Inquiry is a refereed scholarly journal, which is devoted to
establishing the area of "learning" as a focus for transdisciplinary
study. The journal's goal is to be a forum centered on learning that
remains open to varied objects of enquiry, including machine, human,
plant and animal learning as well as the processes of learning in
business, government, and the professions, both in informal and
formal environments. The audience for this journal is anyone
interested in learning, understanding its contexts, and anticipating
its future.
The first volume of Learning Inquiry has included papers from a wide
variety of perspectives that have helped to frame the discourse we
hope the journal will engender.  Our first issue, on the futures of
learning included contributions from Gary Natriello, Erik De Corte,
Helen Verran, Mark Warschauer, Stuart Moulthrop, Douglas Kellner and
Heinz Mandl on Discovery Networks, Metaphysics and Learning, Play,
and Knowledge Management. Leonard J. Waks brought together a "Special
Issue on Listening and Reflecting" with participation from Sophie
Haroutunian-Gordon, Stanton Wortham, Latherine Schultz, Suzanne Rice,
Elizabeth Meadows, Megan Laverty, Andrea English, A. G. Rud and Jim
Garrison Past and forthcoming contributions cover topics as diverse
as  the ethical challenges of training brain surgeons, organizational
learning theory, futures of digital learning, music and math,
learning and discipline, and situated cognition.
Learning Inquiry strives to strike a balance between presenting
innovative research and documenting current knowledge to foster a
scholarly dialogue on learning independent of domain and
methodological restrictions. Learning Inquiry also presents special
issues that identify the central areas of learning inquiry to provide
focus for future research.

Subject: Esse 9 Conference Panel.
Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2008 08:38:49 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 652 (652)

ESSE 9 conference -- Aarhus, Denmark, 22-26 August 2008:
Seminar 20: Shakespeare and Discourse Stylistics.
The next ESSE conference will be held at the
University of Aarhus Denmark from 22 to 26 August
2008. We invite papers for seminar 20 on Shakespeare and Discourse=
  Stylistics
  From copia to stylistic reticence, Shakespeare's
playtexts map out the extreme limits and
impasse of verbal communication. The present
seminar aims at assessing and highlighting the
discourse strategies and structures at stake in
conversational exchange and interaction in the
very process of capturing the world of human
understanding and relationships. Such a process
involves the difficulty, sometimes the
impossibility, and the exhilaration of mediating
that world through language. Shakespeare's
playtexts should be envisaged as being rooted in
a cultural and rhetorical context in which
meaning (and the difficulties of conveying
meaning) is a collaborative construction,
involving author, text, culture, and reader.
Papers are welcome on the range of Shakespeare's
negotiations with the problematics of the
production of meaning. Areas of exploration
include textual stylistics, semantics, pragmatics, and semiotics.
Contact details for Panel 20:
Dr. Mireille Ravassat (University of Valenciennes, France)
E-mail: mireilleravassat_at_yahoo.fr
Dr. Lene Petersen (University of the West of England, Bristol, UK)
E-mail: Lene.Petersen_at_uwe.ac.uk
Those wishing to participate in the Conference
are invited to submit 200-word abstracts of their
proposed papers directly to both convenors of the
seminar in question before 1 March 2008. The
convenors will let the proponents know whether
their proposals have been accepted no later than 21 March 2008.

Academic Integrity
In recent years, plagiarism and cheating have been highlighted in the
news.  Whether discussing high-profile cases like Stephen Ambrose and
Doris Kearns Goodwin or reviewing works on the subject by notables like
Judge Richard Posner, the public appears keenly interested in
plagiarism. Plagiarism detection devices, once all the rage are, with
greater intensity, being challenged legally and ethically as
inappropriate vehicles for detecting plagiarism. Most recently,
Turnitin.com is in the middle of litigation challenging its business
practices as violations of copyright law.
Please join the Center for Intellectual Property as we attempt to
address the plagiarism and cheating issues on college campuses and try
to build communities that value academic integrity.

Studies show that establishing a community of shared academic values
fosters academic integrity in the classroom. However, establishing that
community may be more difficult when students adopt the values of a
digital "remix" culture that challenges the traditional understanding of
authorship. How do institutions foster academic integrity values in
light of changing cultural norms? Are there special techniques and tools
required? Are the best tools to use in preventing academic dishonesty
"technical" like Turnitin.com? And are there additional legal and
ethical issues involved when using technical measures to prevent
academic dishonesty? Please see site for detailed course objectives-

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 655 (655)

Willard,
With OpenDocument Format as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 26300) and OpenXML being debated for
approval as an ISO standard, markup is more
relevant than ever before for computing
humanists. In the not too distant future (closer
that I suspect many of us thought) the default
format for most documents is going to be XML.
Humanists readers should be interested in a new
markup conference in Montreal, Canada this coming
August that focuses on the leading edge of markup technology.
Its organizers describe the conference as:
"Balisage is a peer-reviewed conference designed
to meet the needs of markup theoreticians and
practitioners who are pushing the boundaries of
the field. It=92s all about the markup -- how to
create it; what it means; hierarchies and
overlap; modeling; taxonomies; transformation;
query, searching, and retrieval; presentation and
accessibility; making systems that make markup
dance (or dance faster to a different tune in a
smaller space) -- in short, changing the world and
the web through the power of marked-up information."
Further details can be found at:

Apologies for cross-postings
A reminder that proposals for papers to be included in the following
panel are due 1 February 2008:
CALL FOR PAPERS
2009 ASGLE Joint AIA/APA Panel
Philadelphia, PA, January 8-11 2009
The Publication and Study of Inscriptions in the Age of the Computer
Organized by Paul Iversen and Tom Elliott
The computer age has unleashed powerful new technologies that enhance
the study of Greek and Latin inscriptions, yet most scholars,
academic institutions and publishing houses are still not comfortable
with the idea of publishing inscriptions in a form that takes full
advantage of the new possibilities. The Society, therefore, welcomes
papers that discuss current or possible future computer-enhanced
initiatives in the areas of Greek and Latin Epigraphy. We are
particularly interested in papers that discuss theoretical
applications of new technologies to the field of epigraphy and the
formulation of international standards and protocols of publication
and institutional credit, especially digital projects that go well
beyond the mere encoding of the appearance of epigraphical sigla and
indicia (which is akin to putting old wine into new wineskins) to
include the en-coding of semantic and/or observational distinctions.
Abstracts will be adjudicated anonymously by a committee of ASGLE and
should not be longer than one page. Please follow the instructions
for the format of individual abstracts that will appear in the

   Epistemic Networks and GRID + Web 2.0 for Arts and Humanities
       30-31 January 2008, Imperial College Internet Centre,
                      Imperial College London
Data driven Science has emerged as a new model 
which enables researchers to move from 
experimental, theoretical and computational 
distributed networks to a new paradigm for 
scientific discovery based on large scale GRID 
networks (NSF/JISC Digital Repositories Workshop, 
AZ 2007). Hundreds of thousands of new digital 
objects are placed in digital repositories and on 
the web everyday, supporting and enabling 
research processes not only in science, but in 
medicine, education, culture and government.  It 
is therefore important to build interoperable 
infra-structures and web-services that will allow 
for the exploration, data-mining, semantic 
integration and experimentation of arts and 
humanities resources on a large scale.  There is 
a growing consensus that GRID solutions alone are 
too heavy, and that coupling it with Web 2.0 
allows for the development of a more light-weight 
service oriented architecture (SOA) that can 
adapt readily to user needs by using on demand 
utility computing, such as morphological tools, 
mash-ups, surf clouds, annotation and automated 
workflows for composing multiple services.  The 
goal is not just to have fast access to digital 
resources in the arts and humanities, but to have 
the capacity to create new digital resources, 
interrogate data and form hypotheses about its 
meaning and wider context.  Clearly what needs to 
emerge is a mixed-model of GRID + Web 2.0 
solutions for the arts and humanities which 
creates an epistemic network that supports a four 
step iterative process: (i) retrieval, (ii) 
contextualisation, (iii) narrative and hypothesis 
building, and (iv) creating contextualised 
digital resources in semantically integrated 
knowledge networks.  What is key here is not just 
managing new data, but the capacity to share, 
order, and create knowledge networks from 
existing resources in a semantically accessible form.
To create epistemic networks in the arts and 
humanities there are core technologies that must 
be developed.  The aim of this expert METHNET 
Workshop is to focus on developing a strategy for 
the implementation of these core technologies on 
an inter-national scale by bringing together GRID 
computing specialists with researchers from 
Classics, Literature and History who have been 
involved in the creation and use of electronic 
resources.  The core technologies we will focus 
on in this two day work-shop are: (i) 
infrastructure, (ii) named entity, identity and 
co-reference services, (iii) morphological 
services and parallel texts, (iv) epistemic 
networks and virtual research environments.  The 
idea is to bring together expertise from the UK, 
US, and European funded projects to agree upon a 
common strategy for the development of core 
infra-structure and web-services for the arts and 
humanities that will enable the use of GRID technologies for advanced research.

The Glint and Glitter of Glass: The Future of Publishing with a
Post-DNA Alphabet
Nathaniel Bobbitt
We live in a time that never was and never will be again. Such clever
statements can be reflected in the media works of Beckett and the
methodical "image-related thoughts" of Escher's studies of the plane
(color symmetry). We sit on the schism between the interval (Zeno)
and the computer (Turing). The following introduces a ruler (Cantor)
as a substitute for doing humanities (creative, analytic, scholarly)
with computers.  Since the discovery of the structure of DNA, the
advent of fractals, and micro-computing the stage has been set for
greater contributions to the body of human knowledge with one draw-back:
An inability to interact directly with nature.
By developing a post-DNA alphabet I have arrived at a system to mark
difference through a system of rulers (fractals).
This system offers methods that bring to the humanities and life
sciences the prospect of doing research through direct interact with nature.
A post-DNA alphabet revisits earlier attempts at inventing language
(Joyce, Cummings, Pound, Fenollosa, and G.Urton) and understanding
structure (Darwin, Watson, Peirce, Barthes, Bassler, and J. Hawkins).
In each of these cases the machine, the artifact (document), and
function is overlaid with a lithographic based mode of communication.
The implementation of a new symbol system (character set) needs to
also identify its own communication theory as found in: Internet,
social networks, or  brain plasticity. The prospect of developing a
post-DNA alphabet leads to the implementation of a publishing
infrastructure that foregos lithographic forms of information exchange.
William Blake had already anticipated the importance of the
publishing process (acid technique) in a visionary expression:
"...This I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, with
corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting
apparent surfaces away, and revealing the infinite which was hid"
The role of developing a publishing infrastructure (optical) is to
form a new view of documents that looks beyond the artifact found
through digitization. What is ready for incubation will illustrate
the role of visualization and simulation in scholarship,
classification, and technical or expressive communication.
I am looking for projects, researchers, and opportunities to further
collaborate: to teach the global community a new language that breaks
the information barrier with a fresh pattern to interact with nature.
A multi-faceted character set has been designed to mark difference
through a system of highlights. See:
<a href="http://www.nabslab.com">http://www.nabslab.com</a>
See page 5:
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/i-m/resources/downloads2006/IM2.1SubmissionCompendium.pdf">http://web.mit.edu/i-m/resources/downloads2006/IM2.1SubmissionCompendium.pdf</a>
As we turn towards natural computing (Paun, T. Head, Adleman) a
symbolic system forms the seeds for natural computing sensors.
Without a proper character set the ability to do science or
philosophy with computers lags without the necessary symbolic or
computational structure.

Workshop Purpose:
The CSLP 2008 workshop addresses the question of 
constraints and language processing from an 
interdisciplinary perspective. Constraints are 
widely used in linguistics, computer science, and 
psychology. How they are used, however, varies 
widely according to the research domain: natural 
language processing, knowledge representation, 
cognitive modelling, problem solving mechanisms, 
etc. The purpose is to pursue a paradigm, 
unifying the different approaches into a common 
framework capable of explaining how constraints 
play a role in representing, processing and 
acquiring linguistic information, and this from a 
formal, technical, and cognitive perspective.
Workshop Topics:
The topics include, but are not limited to, 
constraint-based linguistic theories, constraints 
in human language comprehension and production, 
context modelling and discourse interpretation, 
acquisition of constraints, probabilistic 
constraint-based reasoning, constraint 
satisfaction technologies and constraint logic programming.

Subject: Google hosting research data
Date: Wed, 23 Jan 2008 07:05:37 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 665 (665)

Dear all,
I was reading recently about the plans of Google to start hosting
research data.[1]  They are launching a service in which they are
starting with 120 terabytes of hubble space telescope data, and in
addition the images of the Archimedes Palimpsest, which partly has
inspired this Google project.  The site will supposedly feature ways
for members of the public to tag and annotate data, like images on
flickr and videos on you-tube. (And these features and services have
certainly created tangible benefits to our global society.)   While
making more data available online, especially to the
information-poor, can only be seen as a good thing, announcements
like this always leave me with a slightly uncertain sense of unease.
If there is an increasing amount of annotation on such data, what
technologies will develop to sort the wheat from the chaff. Sometimes
my unease this is because I'm uncertain of how the service will
operate, (i.e. will just anyone be able to annotate? Can I store my
TEI texts there?) and sometimes because I worry about Google's
motives (they don't really care *what* content, they just want as
much as possible).  The issues of online storage are, of course,
quite interesting in their problems, limitations, and true costs.[3]
I was interested partly because all the announcements are quite plain
in citing both the hubble telescope and the Archimedes Palimpsest,
and I was wondering if this was a conscious pairing of science and
humanities data. Obviously part of my interest is piqued by this
owing to the upcoming death of the AHDS (though the OTA will continue!).
A place where one can dump, and then successively add to and
annotate, research data certainly has its place and I will watch this
development with interest. But this, and many other developments
always seem to fall far short of the co-operative virtual research
development platform that I've always wanted. What I want is a
sourceforge-for-humanists, where we can undertake truly collaborative
research but with the benefits of software development tools (such as
a free subversion repository, web presence, bug tracking, forums,
etc.), but alongside of that all the tools one might wish for a
variety of humanities endeavours. (Say, if a small group of us were
working on a critical edition, then image, image+text proofreading,
variant reading tools, assisted editing, online markup editors,
etc.  But the point isn't just to allow this one activity, but any
countless number of collaborative workflows.)  There have been a
number of attempts at this kind of thing, which always seem to fall
short of the possibilities.  I can't picture such a thing happening
without significant commercial backing, and can't envision a
company's business model which would help to create such a thing.
In any case, I was wondering what other readers thought about this
latest development in Google's mission to control, I mean 'organize',
the world's information?  Is my unease warranted, or am I just paranoid?

Subject: no killer app but work to be done
Date: Wed, 23 Jan 2008 07:04:43 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 667 (667)

Yesterday I was in a meeting with some people who share my desire if
not need to reach the sceptics and reason with them about the
validity of what we do in the digital humanities. One of these asked
us to name or guess at the "killer app" that would at least make such
sceptics vulnerable to persuasion. The answer that came back was that
no such thing exists nor will -- because sceptical scholars will
always be wanting to see not so much whatever tool might be a
candidate but results from that or other tools which back up the
claims made. My contribution to the response was to stress the
quality of the argument made. Indeed, I'm inclined to think that such
argument comes first but needs to be backed up with evidence. There's
different kinds of evidence: (a) the disciplinarily specific kind,
that shows what happens when e.g. a particular prosopographical tool
is used to demonstrate the identity of a person from historical
records that were formerly thought not to be related; (b) the kind
which demonstrates in support of claims we tend to make that a
discipline or disciplinary specialism has actually changed course
because of such things; (c) the kind that records a given scholar's
metanoia on seeing what can be done in his or her specialism; (d) the
kind that results when many of (c) are recorded, studied and
convincingly presented. Any others?
My experience suggests that those of us closely involved can manage

Open Scholarship: Authority, Community and Sustainability in the Age of Web 2.0
Scholarly communications, in particular scholarly publications, are
undergoing tremendous changes. Researchers, universities, funding
bodies, research libraries and publishers are responding in different
ways, from active experimentation, adaptation, to strong resistance.
The ELPUB2008 conference will focus on key issues on the future of
scholarly communications resulting from the intersection of semantic
web technologies, the development of cyberinfrastructure for
humanities and the sciences, and new dissemination channels and
business models. We welcome a wide variety of papers from members of
these communities whose research and experiments are transforming the
nature of scholarly communications. Topics include but are not restricted to:
*   New Publishing models, tools, services and roles
*   New scholarly constructs and discourse methods
*   Innovative business models for scholarly publishing
*   Multilingual and multimodal interfaces
*   Services and technology for specific user communities, media, and content
*   Content search, analysis and retrieval
*   Interoperability, scalability and middleware infrastructure to
facilitate awareness and discovery
*   Personalisation technologies (e.g. social tagging, folksonomies,
RSS, microformats)
*   Metadata creation, usage and interoperability
*   Semantic web issues
*   Data mining, text harvesting, and dynamic formatting
*   User generated content and its relation to publisher's content
*   Usage and citation impact
*   Security, privacy and copyright issues
*   Digital preservation, content authentication

True, you can't convince the skeptics. . .you still can't say
that digitial music has wiped out analog music because a few
places still make analog records which are really better, not
that a true skeptic needs those last few words.
Even when there are more eBooks than paper books, no way.
Even when there are 100 times as many eBooks, not happening.
It's not going to matter what they SAY about eBooks, reality
is going in that direction and paper books will never reverse
that trend, simply because you can /OWN/ MILLIONS OF eBOOKS IN
A TERABYTE DRIVE [costing under $200].
Before Gutenberg the average person could own zero books.
Before Project Gutenberg an average person could own 0 libraries.
It's literally as simple as that.
The cost/benefit ratio for eBooks is too much better than paper.

American/African Diaspora Studies Conference
Call for Posters and Demonstrations
Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies Conference
University of Maryland, College Park May 2-3, 2008
URL: <a href="http://www.mith2.umd.edu/diaspora2008">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/diaspora2008</a>
The Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies
Conference is issuing a call for posters that highlight digital
humanities projects, tools or techniques or work in progress as they
relate to the themes of the conference. We especially encourage
submissions from independent scholars and scholars associated with
academic institutions. Posters may include a demonstration,
traditional printed poster, or a combination of both. Wireless
internet access will be available at the poster venue.
Short abstracts (250-500 words) should be submitted to Neil Fraistat
at fraistat_at_umd.edu by 6 p.m. on February 25, 2008. The proposals will
be reviewed by the planning committee and successful applicants will
be notified by March 10, 2008. The poster session will take place on
the afternoon of May 3, 2008.
This conference will address the increasing centrality of digitization
to the archiving of materials, as well as the growth of digital
technology in the teaching, scholarship and artistic production in the
field of African American/African Diaspora Studies. The conference is
a collaboration involving the African American/African Diaspora Area
Group of the English Department, the Maryland Institute for Technology
in the Humanities (MITH), and the School of Architecture, Planning &
Preservation, as well as other faculty and students from the College
of Arts and Humanities (ARHU) and the College of Behavioral and Social
Sciences (BSOS).
The conference, the first of its kind, will bring together
approximately 150 national and international scholars, high school and
middle school teachers, artists, students and attendees to discuss a
growing body of work that has not as yet benefited from an organized
forum that would allow practitioners to meet one another not only to
discuss on-going projects, but also to debate the theoretical,
methodological, and pedagogical issues raised by the intersection of
the fields of Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora
Studies. As the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies can
benefit from a thoughtful consideration of the application of new
media tools, so, too, can the field of digital humanities benefit from
a focused discussion of scholarship informed by critical race studies.
The program will begin on May 1st and 2nd with hands-on workshops,
including one sponsored by the TEI Consortium and funded by the NEH,
which will provide a practical introduction to text encoding and
another that will focus on navigating online resources in African
American and African Diaspora Studies. The workshops will be followed
by a panel showcasing work by scholars in the field of African
American/African Diaspora Studies that address and/or make use of
digital technologies and new media. The chair and the respondents will
be University of Maryland graduate students. The keynote address by
Abdul Alkalimat (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) will be
followed by a reception and the presentation of a multi-media art
installation.  The last day will be taken up by panels and seminars,
one of which will be geared toward middle and high school teachers;
digital "poster" sessions, using laptops, to introduce projects by
students, faculty and independent scholars; and a closing multi-media
performance. Confirmed participants include Abdul Alkalimat, Howard
Dodson, Anna Everett, Jerome Handler, Paul D. Miller (AKA  DJ Spooky),
Alexander Weheliye, and Pamela Z.

Subject: Re: 21.496 no killer app but work to be done
Date: Fri, 25 Jan 2008 09:23:37 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 676 (676)

The difficulty with finding a "killer app" is that you're asking for objective
results rather than subjective results. I do not anticipate a mechanism for
objective results in literary analysis, nothing like the discovery of carbon-14
dating for physical paper.
What things do seem to divert the course of events in Humanities Computing?
First and foremost are new FREE resources. Project Gutenberg certainly changed
the course of humanities research, providing etexts of classics. It also
provided a mechanism for large cultural organizations (like Canada!) to promote
their historial literature worldwide with minimal cost. Whenever resources are
made available for free they promote grass-roots investigations that otherwise
wouldn't take place. The Linguistic Data Consortium preserves data, but hasn't
had the same sort of impact because its data is so expensive, especially to
individuals without sufficient institutional backing. The Oxford Text Archive
is somewhere in the middle, with modest cost requirements. I think there is a
direct inverse correlation between the cost of resources and the impact of
digital information. Google is a strange blend of free and proprietary data
such that its well-publicized projects (Google Maps, Google Books, Google's
N-grams) have some dramatic impact, but NO serious impact when you reach for
the data they don't release (e.g., the OCR text of Google Books in the public
domain released as PDF image files).
The FREE avialability of the Wiki software also appears to have had a
significant impact on what can be done. This impact is muted only by the
relative difficulty for non-systems programmers in using this FREE software.
What would greatly alter that would be for someone to offer a free downloadable
plug-and-play Wikimedia software system for Windows PCs. Download this, run
this, and you can create a Wiki on your system. I personally believe Wikis are
the most significant non-Microsoft Office killer app of the last several years.
Wikis realize in practice what Apple hinted at in hypercards, but failed to
achieve because they couldn't scale upward to users expectations.
Lacking FREE resources, the next best thing are additions to nearly universally
used commercial software. The first "killer app" was spreadsheets in
Microsoft's Excel. The reason that "app" was a killer probably had more to do
with its inclusion in the widely distributed standard Microsoft Office suite of
software than with its perceived utility. If spreadsheets had been sold as a
stand-alone product from XYZ-corporation, marketed to accountants and costing
$1000 each unit; it wouldn't have been a "killer app". Anything that gets added
into a nearly universally available software utility can have significant
impact.
Customized software packages that require specific purchases for each
discipline
are limited in what they can achieve. This is a software analogy with
a standard
axiom of hardware development. Special purpose computers cannot compete
long-term with general purpose computers. The cost of special-purpose products
is not contained in the one-time creation of the product, but in the lifelong
maintenance and upgrading of the product. Usually, the general purpose
product's upgrades will completely overtake the special purpose product in a
couple of generations---and generations are only 18 months apart.
In software the product never exceeds its targeted market, and hence can't
achieve "killer app" status because that requires the general computing public
to find applications for the software not anticipated by its developers.
The fact that a spreadsheet can hold historical data, literary references,
compile footnoted references, build indexes, etc. are all beyond its envisioned
role as an accounting system utility.
So, there you have it. I think the Humanities should pour labor into projects
such as Project Gutenberg. While the publishing lobby managed to block public
domain texts from extending after 1923 for the rest of our lifetimes, that
still leaves not only a vast amount of text before 1923 to be captured but the
prospect of obtaining permission from post-1923 authors for submission of their
still-copyrighted works.
Project Gutenberg however needs help becoming more authoratitive (just as Wikis
need help becoming more scholarly and reliable). The Project Gutenberg aversion
to identifying specific editions of texts is damaging to the ability to use the
data for more comprehensive digital computing. It is highly commendable that
Project Gutenberg is exemplary in their standards for accurate text, but
lacking the ability to know which editions of a work are being represented
limits the applications of the data. Once again, it is not the perceived goal
of the developers (making texts available to human readers) but the ability of
the data to find additional uses (e.g., corpus linguistic analyses) that
distinguishes good resources from broadening their appeal to the level of a
"killer app".

Subject: Online annotation in digital editions
Date: Sat, 26 Jan 2008 09:47:50 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 678 (678)

Dear colleagues,
I am compiling a list of digital editions that offer interactive online
annotation facilities. (For now) I am not interested in annotation tools
with eg. CD-rom based editions, or in external annotation tools that
might be used in conjunction with the digital edition, such as Google
Notebook, Diigo or Notefish.
The reason that I am interested is that the subject of my upcoming PhD
thesis is annotation facilities and their application in research. My
focus is on emblem books, but the subject is much wider. I am
specifically interested in annotation in scholarly text editions, but it
is hard to define these terms (=91scholarly=92, =91text=92, and
=91edition=92) precisely, and there is no need to do so here. What is
important is that it should be possible to annotate not just at the
level of the text, but at the level of text constituents =AD pages,
paragraphs or other.
There is a draft section of the thesis on=20
<a href="http://www.peterboot.nl/onlineannotationdraft.pdf">http://www.peterboot.nl/onlineannotationdraft.pdf</a>. I list the sites that
I discuss there below. I'd like to hear about sites that I missed,
especially if they offer facilities that are=20
significantly different from the sites that I mention.
Thank you for your suggestions,

Wikisource and wikibooks
Wikis are not very suitable tools for annotation, but the wiki is what
most people tend to think of when I talk about annotation.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)
Sharable Corpus and Best Practice Guidelines Working Group Sessions
1-6PM, May 27, 2008
The Second Linguistic Annotation Workshop
Held in conjunction with LREC 2008
Marrakech, Morocco
<<a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/LAW2008/">http://verbs.colorado.edu/LAW2008/</a>><a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/LAW2008/">http://verbs.colorado.edu/LAW2008/</a>
The SIGANN Sharable Corpus and Best Practice Guidelines Working
Groups will hold a joint session at the Second Linguistic Annotation
Workshop on the afternoon of May 27, 2008, in Marrakech, Morocco. The
session will be devoted to issues surrounding the merging and
harmonization of linguistic annotations representing various
phenomena that may have been produced by different groups using
different formats, and may be based on different theoretical
approaches. The discussions will use as a point of departure
linguistic annotations of a portion of the SIGANN Sharable Corpus
contributed by members of the computational linguistics community.
We solicit contributions of manually or automatically produced
annotations of the SIGANN Sharable Corpus for any linguistic
phenomenon, including but not limited to morpho-syntax, syntax,
semantic roles, word senses, named entities, temporal elements,
events, co-reference and other discourse-level phenomena. The
annotations will be collected in early April, after which the session
organizers will coordinate an effort to merge and compare the
contributed annotations. Based on the experience of this exercise,
discussion points including examples will be drawn up for
consideration in the joint session. Issues to be considered will include:
(1)  What are the issues/problems of merging diverse annotations of
different phenomena into a single multi-layer annotation, in terms of
harmonizing different physical formats?
(2)  What are the issues/problems of merging diverse annotations of
different phenomena into a single multi-layer annotation, in terms of
enabling a coherent and comprehensive linguistic description?
(3)  Are there phenomena for which an attempt at
compatibility/harmonization is not desirable?
(4)  What are the implications and/or suggestions of this exercise
for the development of best practice guidelines for linguistic annotation?
(5)  Are there certain phenomena (e.g. segmentation into tokens,
phrases, etc.) that lend themselves more readily to the specification
of standard practices, and for which the existence of a common method
would enhance annotation interoperability?
(6)  What are the good and bad consequences of introducing a
theoretical bias into the merging process? A theoretically biased
merging procedure creates essentially a new annotation that uses
previously created annotation as input in a destructive manner so
that the input annotation can not be read directly from the merged
output. Can the creation of a merged annotation that is consistent
with a theory justify making these changes?  Can "errors" in input
annotation be detected in this way
Those who wish to contribute annotations and/or be involved in
discussions at the session should consult the LAW II website for
details: <<a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/LAW2008/">http://verbs.colorado.edu/LAW2008/</a>>,
or contact the session organizers.

Subject: Online annotation in digital editions
Date: Sat, 26 Jan 2008 09:47:50 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 681 (681)

Dear colleagues,
I am compiling a list of digital editions that offer interactive online
annotation facilities. (For now) I am not interested in annotation tools
with eg. CD-rom based editions, or in external annotation tools that
might be used in conjunction with the digital edition, such as Google
Notebook, Diigo or Notefish.
The reason that I am interested is that the subject of my upcoming PhD
thesis is annotation facilities and their application in research. My
focus is on emblem books, but the subject is much wider. I am
specifically interested in annotation in scholarly text editions, but it
is hard to define these terms ('scholarly', 'text', and
'edition') precisely, and there is no need to do so here. What is
important is that it should be possible to annotate not just at the
level of the text, but at the level of text constituents' pages,
paragraphs or other.
There is a draft section of the thesis on
<a href="http://www.peterboot.nl/onlineannotationdraft.pdf">http://www.peterboot.nl/onlineannotationdraft.pdf</a>. I list the sites that
I discuss there below. I'd like to hear about sites that I missed,
especially if they offer facilities that are
significantly different from the sites that I mention.
Thank you for your suggestions,
Peter Boot
Wikisource and wikibooks
Wikis are not very suitable tools for annotation, but the wiki is what
most people tend to think of when I talk about annotation.
See for examples:
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Annotations_of_The_Complete_Peanuts">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Annotations_of_The_Complete_Peanuts</a>,

Weblogging and CommentPress
Most weblog tools come with elementary comment facilities; CommentPress
is an add-on for structured comments in WordPress.

E.g. in <a href="http://digital.library.ucla.edu/canonlaw/">http://digital.library.ucla.edu/canonlaw/</a>
Collaboratories
A number of sites offer facilities for collaboration of which annotation
is only an ingredient (Collate, Ipsa, HyperNietzsche). A recent addition
is Footnote (www.footnote.com), commercial and not geared towards
scholarly use, but very remarkable in its range of annotation
facilities.

Description:
The goal of research on culture and IT is diverse in both context and
method. Rather than focusing on cross-cultural studies that compare
IT development and use in different countries, the focus of this
mini-track is to provide a forum for research that seeks to
understand the values and assumptions embedded in both the
technology, and the human group served by the technology (i.e. the
occupational group, the organization, the society). Recent articles
(e.g. Leidner & Kayworth, 2006) continue to call for more attention
to values and cultural assumptions associated with IT if we are to be
successful in addressing various types of conflict.
We would like to make AMCIS the main venue for reporting issues and
research associated with occupational, organizational, and social
cultural issues. Specifically, we would like to see a forum for
exploration of changes in embedded values, assumptions and social
change related to information and communication technologies. Even
the concept of "IT culture" can be interpreted in many ways. We see
this concept of "IT culture" as a complex organizational phenomenon
thatis suitable for an AMCIS mini-track.
Suggested topics:
* The IT culture, the information culture, the digital culture, the
online culture, the geek culture, and culture in virtual environments
* Organizational culture, information systems and management
* IT cultural issues in organizations and in modern society, such as
the "generational divide", and cultural change due to information and
communication technologies
* IT Culture and other issues such as education, security, change, etc.
* IT culture and system conflicts within organizations and society
* Impact of IT culture on occupational, organizational and societal use of IT
* Occupational Culture, the IT workforce, end-user studies where
culture matters
* Methodological issues conducting IT culture research (i.e. case
studies, ethnography, mixed methods)
* An assessment of software for supporting culture studies
* Ethnography and culture in virtual environments

Subject: OR08 Repository Developer
Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2008 06:41:24 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 685 (685)

Challenge: Invitation to Participate
Repository developers are invited to participate in a new "Repository
Challenge" prize activity to produce demonstrations of novel
repository capability during the OR08 conference.
The Open Repositories conference annually attracts developers who
working on a wide variety of repository-oriented platforms and
projects from across the world. As well as providing a forum for
discussion of the cutting edge of repository R&D, this year's
conference will run a rapid cross-platform repository integration
challenge. The aim is to get delegates working in small teams to try
to quickly pull together established platforms and services to
demonstrate a glimpse of some real-life, user-relevant scenarios and
services. The "Repository Challenge" will be based around small teams
of developers trying to achieve goals set by the repository manager
and user community. This all takes place in a "scrapheap-code
challenge [UK]" / "junkyard-code wars[US]" atmosphere over the two
days of the conference. An awards ceremony at the conference dinner
will celebrate the achievements of the teams with cash prizes given to
the best demos (first team prize =2,500 / $5,000 / &#x20ac;3.350).
The Repository Challenge is intended to provide concrete examples of
the ideas raised at a recent Repository Unconference, an event run by
the JISC Common Repository Interface Group (CRIG) to identify key
issues that repositories need to address to make a genuine impact in
Higher Education. These include bringing the repository closer to the
researcher's working environment,  automatically generating metadata,
running multiple interfaces and taking advantage of Web 2.0 and
utility computing services.
To participate in the repository challenge, 
register for OR08 at 
<a href="http://or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">http://or08.ecs.soton.ac.uk/</a>  and email the 
Repository Challenge Chair: David Flanders (d.flanders_at_bbk.ac.uk ).
Comments are invited on the outputs of the Unconference (photos of the
flipcharts) which are available at

PS Although this is not an ostensibly "Open Access" technical
challenge, the suggested improvements will improve OA provision by
making document and metadata deposit easier. But such efforts will
only be effective as part of balanced diet of OA policy and technical
development!

Speaker Added! and More!
Greetings,
You still have time. We have extended the "Early Registration" date for
the academic integrity online workshop to Friday, February 15, 2008.
Once all the rage, plagiarism detection devices are, with greater
intensity, being challenged legally and ethically as inappropriate tools
for detecting plagiarism. Currently, the plagiarism detection service
Turnitin.com is in the middle of litigation against several high school
students who are challenging its business practices as a violation of
copyright law. In this workshop, the legal and scholarly implications of
this struggle will be explored, along with the many challenges in
fostering academic integrity in our colleges & universities. Join the
moderators and our special chat guest:
	*Don McCabe*, Professor of Management & Global Business, Rutgers
Business School - Newark & New Brunswick. Professor McCabe has conducted
research on college and university student perceptions and attitudes
towards cheating in the US & Canada. Most recently he has shifted that
focus and has surveyed over 18,000 high school students in the United
States.
Please join the Center for Intellectual Property as we attempt to
address the plagiarism and cheating issues on college campuses and
attempt to outline practices for change:

Chris,
Regarding Croquet, have they actually written the code that allows
Word (or another office app) to be pulled into the environment?  Last
time I saw it, there was a mock up of using word in the croquet
environment, but no actual code yet.  It was about 9 months ago.

Hi,
I would like to also put forth our own ImaNote 
tool developed at the Media Lab Helsinki.
ImaNote
<<a href="http://imanote.uiah.fi/about">http://imanote.uiah.fi/about</a>><a href="http://imanote.uiah.fi/about">http://imanote.uiah.fi/about</a>
The tool allows for different groups of 
researchers to annotate maps and images. The tool 
was originally developed for use in the 
Digital Facsimile of the Map of Mexico 1550 project.

Subject: experience and communication
Date: Thu, 31 Jan 2008 08:17:26 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 691 (691)

In the Introduction to his wonderful Essays in Experimental Logic
(1916), American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey speaks of the
problems caused by the view that experience only exhibits ideas but
has nothing essential to do with having them -- the belief that "the
natural scene and operations of our life are lacking in ideal import,
[with] the consequent tendency to flee for the lacking ideal factors
to some other world inhabited exclusively by ideals."
[deleted quotation]He goes on.
[deleted quotation]With the readjusted mixture of ideation, experiment and experience of
the world that has come about with computing, is there not the
opportunity to do somewhat better, esp with communicating to a
troubled and troubling public the role of what we do in the life of society?
Comments?

I would be very grateful to know of any musicological scholarship
that has stepped beyond "music information retrieval" to attempt
modelling the musical imagination -- interpretational, improvisational
or otherwise. I know of the writings of Margaret Boden and Philip
Johnson-Laird on this subject but would appreciate more.
I would also be grateful for anything of a similar kind in
historiography, i.e. concerned with the reconstruction (i.e.
modelling) of what presumably was or modelling of what might have been.
That this sort of thing happens is clear, and people do make claims
to that effect. I am looking for critical discussions which actually
examine the process, look for its stress-points etc.
Many thanks.
Yours,
WM

5. Scientists Discuss Artificial Companions
--------------------------------------------------
The Oxford Internet Institute, a Companions project partner, hosted a
workshop meeting of scientists from Europe and the USA to discuss the
future of 'Artificial Companions in Society' in Oxford on October
26th, 2007. Research into such characters is fast expanding and the
general perception is one of a future in which people will become
emotionally attached to these companions and will rely on them in
various ways, such as storing and accessing their personal memories
on the Internet.
The workshop was preceded by a lecture by Sherry Turkle, Abby
Rockefeller Mauze Professor of the Social Studies of Science at MIT
and Technology Director, MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. Her
lecture, entitled 'Cyberintimacies/Cybersolitudes', asked questions
such as 'What kinds of relationships are appropriate to have with machines?'
Papers presented at the workshop, on speakers' perspectives on the
present and future of this emerging science,  included titles such
as: 'Conversationalists, maybe - But Confidants?' (by Margaret
Boden); 'Falling in Love with a Companion' (David Levy); 'Are
Artificial Companions Better Than Real Ones?' (Joanie Gillispie); 'A
Victorian Companion?' (Yorick Wilks) and  'Robots Should be Slaves'
(Joanna Bryson) (the Position papers are available on the Companions website).
The event was organized by Professor Yorick Wilks, Director of the
EU- funded Companions project, on behalf of the e-Horizons Institute,
a unit of the James Martin School of the 21st Century; the workshop
was also supported by Microsoft Research.

6. Feature: Nabaztag as a first Companion
--------------------------------------------------
The Nabaztag rabbit is being used as the first Companion avatar in
two initial demonstrators in the project. In the Health and Fitness
Companion being integrated at the University of Tampere, Nabaztag is
the free- standing rabbit available commercially from Violet in
Paris, adapted with an API so as to receive speech input as well as
output. In the Senior Companion, being integrated at the University
of Sheffield, Nabaztag is appearing as a talking 2D screen rabbit,
discussing the content of personal photos.Nabaztag is the brain-child
of Rafi Halidjan (the name is the Armenian for rabbit). It is a
plastic rabbit that can move its ears, flash colours and speak. Its
input is entirely wifi, driven from a remote website. The standard
use is to convey messages and emotions, all input at a website, to a
remote friend or lover: it can flash blue with ears down and say or
sing 'I miss you', or indeed anything else you type in. Rafi Halidjan
is on the Companions Governing Council and we hope for a closer
relationship in the future as Nabaztag has much of the attractive,
distinctive and expressive quality one wants in a physical embodiment
of the Companion idea: especially as the Tampere version can now
listen as well as talk!
--------------------------------------------------
7. Our Industrial Partners
--------------------------------------------------
Loquendo
The automatic speech recognizer (ASR) and the text-to-speech (TTS)
system integrated in the present Companions demonstrators have been
provided by Loquendo. While themes related to improving acoustic
quality, naturalness, and expressivity of speech generation are
subjects of research done by Loquendo in Companions, the ASR
integrated in the demonstrators is the Loquendo commercial product.
Loquendo ASR can support speech applications that need accurate
recognition of broad vocabularies, up to 1,000,000 forms of words.
The speech recognition engine is based on algorithms that integrate
neural networks and continuous density hidden Markov models. The TTS
pronunciation lexicon ensures that specialized vocabularies,
abbreviations, acronyms, and even regional pronunciation differences,
can sound as the speech application developer intends them to. The
acoustic characteristics of the voices (speech, speaking rate, and
volume) can be fine tuned and controlled at the application level.
<a href="http://www.loquendo.com/en/index.htm">http://www.loquendo.com/en/index.htm</a>
Telefonica
One of the today's buzzwords among telco companies and a technology
that can significantly enable some of the future Companions features
is IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem). This acts as the glue that will
bring today's mobile, fixed and IP telephony into a convergent,
unified entity. IMS will offer significant advantages on concepts
such as multidevice situations, usability, session transferring,
identity tracking, personalization, security and others, all of which
will undoubtedly be crucial in the future Companions prototypes. The
same Telefonica I+D team working on Companions has recently
collaborated in the development of scenarios and implementation for
one of these projects, involving many of the above concepts. Our
mixed presence and identity tracking demonstrator performs
transference of sessions between different devices such as PCs,
smartphones and touch panels, enabling users to perform complex tasks
such as reading their incoming mail and SMS/MMS, accessing the
internet and granting access to their homes. We hope to bring some of
this technology in later stages of the project to make the Companion
not only able to recognise each user's presence, but to follow her or
him along using different devices. <a href="http://www.tid.es/html_eng/index.html">http://www.tid.es/html_eng/index.html</a>
As An Angel
As An Angel is a European SME, founded in 2001, based in Paris,
specialized in human-computer dialogue and agent-based multimodal
interfaces. It has produced a dozen conversational agents, prototypes
and demonstrators for advertising agencies, banks, and other
advertisers. As An Angel is about to launch an online automated
generator of personified avatars, named AngelStudio. This generator
allows the user to develop his or her virtual double in just a few
minutes. This personified and learning avatar will be able to achieve
the following delegated actions such as representing the user on
his/her personal site or blog, meeting sites and forums, online
communities or virtual worlds and simulation games. The first
application of AngelStudio technology is the game SimDate, currently
in its final stage of development and due to launch online in January
2008. In this simulation of a seduction dialogue, the players purpose
is to seduce a character (derived from a real person) through an
instant messaging-like dialogue with a webcam. <a href="http://www.asanangel.com/">http://www.asanangel.com/</a>
Teliasonera
The major undertaking of TeliaSonera has been the development of a
dialogue management method suitable for automatic troubleshooting and
other problem-solving applications. The method has a theorem-proving
flavour, in that it recursively decomposes tasks into sequences of
subtasks and atomic actions. An explicit objective when designing the
method has been that it should be tailored for use by other people
than the designers themselves.  A pilot implementation in the domain
of over-the-phone broadband support has been developed and has been
used for internal data collection in order to validate the basic
ideas and fine-tune the design. We are particularly interested in
trying to apply unsupervised machine learning methods, such as
reinforcement learning, to enable this kind of system to learn to
improve its behaviour by itself. <a href="http://www.teliasonera.com/">http://www.teliasonera.com/</a>

THE GOOD LIFE IN A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE
Multidisciplinary Workshop at the University of Twente, The Netherlands
June 12-14, 2008
Organized by Philip Brey (chair), Adam Briggle, Ed Spence, Johnny Soraker
Department of Philosophy, University of Twente and 3TU.Centre for Ethics
and Technology, the Netherlands.
Maximum number of participants: 32
This workshop will consider the implications of contemporary technology
for the quality of life, and will examine approaches from philosophy and
social and behavioural science for studying the quality of life in a
technological age. Since the industrial revolution, modern technology
has seriously impacted day-to-day life and has engendered changing
ideals of the good life. In recent years, new technologies in the
information, medical, industrial, and other sectors have further
impacted everyday life. In this workshop, different disciplinary
perspectives, from philosophy, psychology, economics and other fields,
will be employed to interpret and evaluate contemporary relations
between technology and the quality of life.

We are looking for contributions that employ conceptions of the quality
of life or well-being that go beyond traditional social-economical
quality-of-life indices, and that consider either the subjective
preferences and psychological states of persons (as in psychology and
welfare economics) or particular normative ideals of the good life (as
developed in philosophy).

PURPOSE/HISTORY:
     This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
     researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
     computing.  Many of the 25 joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
     premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective
     fields.  We anticipate to have 2,600 or more attendees from over 80
     countries participating in the 2008 joint conferences.
     The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
     conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
     place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
     exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
     model used to form these annual conferences facilitates communication
     among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
     computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
     inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and
     outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
     applications) will be covered during the conferences.
     WORLCOMP'08 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
     lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
     poster presentations.  In recent past, keynote and/or tutorial speakers

TECHNOLOGY AND HIGHER EDUCATION'S FUTURE
A new year has brought new publications that contemplate the future
effects of technologies on education. Three of these documents are
presented here.
In "How Technology Will Shape Our Future: Three Views of the
Twenty-First Century" (ECAR Research Bulletin, Issue 2, 2008), Thomas
L. Franke "explores three of the most compelling views of our
longer-term future, the role of technology in those possible futures,
and the impact these alternative futures might have on higher
education. The alternatives range from a future of extreme constraint
and possible collapse . . . to one of unprecedented abundance, where
most of the current work of higher education will be automated. . . ."
The report is available online to members of ECAR subscribing
institutions at
<a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ecar_so/erb/ERB0802.pdf">http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ecar_so/erb/ERB0802.pdf</a>. To find

ECAR (EDUCAUSE Center for Applied Research) "provides timely research
and analysis to help higher education leaders make better decisions
about information technology. ECAR assembles leading scholars,
practitioners, researchers, and analysts to focus on issues of critical
importance to higher education, many of which carry increasingly
complicated and consequential implications." For more information go to

2008 HORIZON REPORT ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
The 2008 Horizon Report is a collaboration between the New Media
Consortium and the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative. Each year the report
"describes six areas of emerging technology that will have significant
impact on higher education within three adoption horizons over the next
one to five years." Some key trends that this year's report calls
attention to include:
Grassroots video: "What used to be difficult and expensive, and often
        required special servers and content distribution networks, now
        has become something anyone can do easily for almost nothing."
Collaboration webs: "The newest tools for collaborative work are small,
        flexible, and free, and require no installation. Colleagues
        simply open their web browsers and they are able to edit group
        documents, hold online meetings, swap information and data, and
        collaborate in any number of ways without ever leaving their
        desks."
Mobile broadband: "New displays and interfaces make it possible to use
        mobiles to access almost any Internet content -- content that
        can be delivered over either a broadband cellular network or a
        local wireless network."
Data mashups: "The availability of large amounts of data . . . is
        converging with the development of open programming interfaces
        for social networking, mapping, and other tools. This in turn
        is opening the doors to hundreds of data mashups that will
        transform the way we understand and represent information."
Collective intelligence: "In the coming years, we will see educational
        applications for both explicit collective intelligence --
        evidenced in projects like the Wikipedia and in community
        tagging -- and implicit collective intelligence, or data
        gathered from the repeated activities of numbers of people,
        including search patterns, cell phone locations over time,
        geocoded digital photographs, and other data that are passively
        obtained."
Social operating systems: "Social operating systems will support whole
        new categories of applications that weave through the implicit
        connections and clues we leave everywhere as we go about our
        lives, and use them to organize our work and our thinking
        around the people we know."

TECHNOLOGY AND EMERGING ISSUES IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES
This month the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL)
Research Committee has published its latest "Environmental Scan," a
report identifying the "major assumptions shaping the practice of
academic librarianship, as well as to identify emergent issues of
concern to the profession." The committee compiled a list of ten
assumptions for the future of academic libraries and librarians and
outlined several "emergent issues" that are predicted to be of
increasing importance.
Some of the assumptions listed include:
-- More emphasis will be placed on digitizing collections, preserving
digital archives.
-- Students and faculty will expect to find a rich digital library
presence.
-- Debates about intellectual property will become increasingly common
in higher education.
-- Demands for technology-related services and technology-rich user
environments will continue to grow and will require additional funding.

described the maps of Napi, the creator of the Blackfoot Indians (aka
The Old Man) and his wife (The Old Woman) in Alberta, Canada. I
"found" similar maps of a male body (Hermes ?) in the Middle East and
a female body (Aphrodite) in north Africa.
Anthropomorphic Maps
Anthropomorphic maps were generated by configuring the body of a god
or goddess over the area to be mapped. The name of each part of that
body became the name of the area or feature under that part. This
produced a scale 1:1 map-without-paper on which each placename
automatically indicated its approximate location and direction with
respect to every other place on the same map whose name was produced
in this way.
You are cordially invited to join the BPMaps discussion group on this

The Challenge: To produce computer software that will find additional
body-part maps elsewhere in the world. Available inputs:
(1) geographic databases with ancient place names (e.g., the Perseus project).
(2) body-part names on Swadesh lists. Unfortunately, the navel is not included.
Attributes of Anthropomorphic Maps
(1) The navel is the center of the body, the center of the map, and
usually the center of the map's language community.
(2) Place names (toponyms) may be reversed, metathesized, misspelled
or euphemized for various reasons:
(a) The same part in the same language exists on another map of a
different body. Cranium > Mo[n]rocco because Ukraine existed?
Aphrodite is looking backwards over her right shoulder. She is bent
at her waist (Misr/Mitzraim = MoSNaiM).
(b) The left (sinister) part is altered in names for left-right pairs
(arms, legs, eyes, ears). DoFeN = side reversed to Nafud in north
Arabia. SHvK = thigh with a T-sound for the letter shin = TvK
reversed to Kuwait. BeReKH = knee metathesized to Bahrain.
(c) Names that represent taboo body parts or funcitons are reversed
or euphemized:
       Semitic PoS (female pudenda) reverses to yam SooF = sea of
reeds (Red Sea).
       Mare Rubrum (Latin for Red Sea) represents Aphrodite's menstruation.
       NeGeV is a reversal of vagina.
       CaNa3an (3 = aiyin with a G-sound as in 3aZa = Gaza) is a
reversal of Greek gyneco-.
       Sinai = "snatch" is spelled SiNi in Hebrew. The aleph=CHS is
intentionally missing.
       ZaYiN = weapon (a euphemism for his male member) is in Sinai as
the desert of Zin.
(3) Names may be loan-translated due to conquest or language-change.
(a) Roxolania (Semitic Ro[chs]SH = head) => Rus *( Ro_at_SH) => Ukraine
(Greek kranion)
       * Caused by a change in the sound of the aleph from CHS to a
glottal stop.
(b) Libya (Semitic LeB = heart) => Cyrenaica (Latin cor = heart,
compare coronary) => Libya
(4) Rivers and bodies of water may be named after bodily excretions:
(a) Milk River in Alberta.
(b) Red Sea (Latin Mare Rubrum) is Aphrodite's menstruation.
(c) Gulf of Aqaba (Semitic QaVaH = digestion/defecation)
(5) Internal body parts may represent subdivisions of external parts.
(a) Arabic Misr / Hebrew Mitzraim (< TSaR = narrow) = waist (Hebrew
MoSNaim). Egypt (< Greek hepato- = liver). Goshen (with a T-sound
shin < Semitic QiTN = bean) = bean-shaped kidney. Goshen exported
Arabic QuTN = cotton => Latin Gossypium (English gossamer = cotton-like)
(b) Atlas mountains < atlas = first cervical vertebra that supports
the cranium.
(6) Islands near a body's hands may be named for weapons.
(a) Trinacria = trident (< Gk tri = three + Semitic NaKaR = to
pierce) => Sicily (< VL *sicila < Latin secula = sickle to harvest
wheat; compare Semitic SaKiN = knife). The trident was in
Neptune/Poseidon's right hand (Italy, like Anatolia < N'TiLas yad =
arm being washed by the seas).
(b) Greece = reversal of Semitic S'RoG = (weighted) net, held in his left hand.
(c) Crete = reversal of targe = small shield (compare English target)
also in his left hand.
Aphrodite
The map of Aphrodite is in north Africa. Her face [PaNim] was lost
during the 3rd Punic war. The rest of her is still there. She is
looking backwards over her right shoulder, so her CRaniuM is reversed
at Morocco. It still has a Fez. Her chin [SaNTir] is reversed at
Tunisia. The Atlas (anatomy: first cervical vertebra) mountains
support her head. Her hair [Sa3aRa] is the Sahara desert. Her
backbone [amood SHiDRa] is the Gulf of Sidra. Her heart [LeB] is
Libya. Her breast [SHaD] is Chad. Her narrow [TZaR] waist is Misr /
Mitzraim. Her liver (Greek hepato-) is Egypt. Cotton (Arabic QuTN,
Latin Gossypium) was exported from Goshen, her [QiTNit = bean]-shaped
kidney. Her side [TZaD] is Sudan. Her other side [DoFeN] is Dafur.
Her left [SMoL] leg is Somalia.
[NeGeV] is a reversal of vagina and may be related to [NeKeV] =
aperture. [CaNa3aN] was her Latin cunnus (and a reversal of Greek
gyneco-). Its name changed to [YiSRa_at_eL] at the time when [Ya3aKoV] /
Jacob "fought with god and men" [Gen 32:29]. This represented a
change in sovereignty from Africa to Asia minor. [ YiSRa_at_eL] is that
body part that gives [@oSHeR] = delight
to [@eL] = god when it is [YaSHaR] = straight, upright. Changing
Jacob's name from [Ya3aKoV] = "ankle; curved, bent" to [YiSRa_at_eL] =
"straight, upright + god" is a well-known Hebrew pun.
Hermes
The body-part map of Hermes is in Asia minor. kHermes [kHoR = hole +
MoSnaim = waist] lived at Mt. kHermon before he moved Mt. Olympus
(Greek omphalos = navel). Later his name was reversed to become Latin
Mercury. Compare Amerigo Vespucci and America.
His head [Ro_at_SH] was at Roxolania/Rus, south of Belarus. Its name
changed to the Ukraine (Gk kranion = cranium, *not *Slavic u kraina =
to/at the border). His throat [GaRGeret] is Georgia. His left
shoulder [KaSaF] is the Caspian sea. His right shoulder [@aTZiL] was
Euxinus, now the Black Sea. His right arm/hand is being washed
[NaTiLat] at Anatolia. His upper arm (Sanskrit irma) at Armenia,
biceps (Greek pontiki = muscle) at Pontus, elbow [KiFooF yaD] at
Cappadocia, wrist [m'FaReK] at Phrygia, and thumb [BoHeN] at Bithynia
were in Anatolia.  His heart (Greek cardia)  became Kurdistan. His
narrow [TZaR] waist is Syria and his navel (Sanskrit nabhila)
reverses to LeBaNon.
South of Lebanon is the male member (Greek phallus) named Philistina.
See [CaNa3aN / YiSRa_at_eL] above. His buttocks [YeReKH] is Iraq. His
thigh [shin-vav-kuf] sounded like TvK and reversed to Kuwait. His
knee [BeReKH] is partially reversed in Bahrain. His right [Y'MiN]
foot is at Yemen.
These two bodies are connected, literally, at Sinai (with an aleph
that is not written in Hebrew, compare "snatch", a reversal of
[K'NiSah] = entrance), a part of her body that contains the desert of
Zin, his "zaiyin". Needless to say, I am not personally responsible
for this connection that occurred over 3000 years ago.
Aphrodite as an Anthropomorphic Map
The goddess we call Aphrodite
Is not just an old Grecian deity.
     The Phoenicians did make
     Her a map. It's not fake.
Her body is cartograffiti.
The Punic war destroyed her face,
The Romans left nary a trace.
     But her hair is still there,
     In Sahara, that's where.
And her chin's a Tunisian place.
Mt. Atlas is her first verTebra.
Her backbone is now Gulf of Sidra.
     Her heart is in Libya,
     Her left leg, Somalia.
Her breast is in Chad wearing no bra.
The Greeks called her liver Egypt, an'
Her kidney was Biblical Goshen.
     She's bent at her waist,
     Now Misr-ably placed.
The Red Sea was her menstruation.
As a kid I did think the Red Sea
Was an English map typo: lost E,
     From Reed Sea in Hebrew.
     But that could not be true,
Mare Rubrum 'twas Latin, B.C.
Aphrodite with Hermes did sin,
We know this is true 'cause within
     Her "snatch" we call Sinai
     His "zaiyin" does still lie.
It's known as the desert of Zin.

Political and Religious Ideologies and the Appraisal of New Media"
[sent on behalf of Johnny Sraker <johnny.soraker_at_hf.ntnu.no>]
The Department of Philosophy of the University of Twente in the
Netherlands is looking for a
Ph.D. Student (M/F, full time)
for the project &#x201c;Cultural, Political and Religious Ideologies and the
Appraisal of New Media&#x201d;
The PhD position is part of a prestigious and exciting international
research project in philosophy named &#x201c;Evaluating the Cultural Quality of
New Media&#x201d;. This five-year project, which includes six researchers and
involves collaboration with leading international scholars and research
centres, has as its aim to develop a framework for better normative
analyses of new media and new media culture, especially in relation to
their contribution to the quality of life (&#x201c;the good life&#x201d;) and the
quality of society. Project leader is Prof. Dr. Philip Brey. The project
is part of a new international Centre of Excellence in Ethics and
Technology (<a href="http://www.ethicsandtechnology.eu">http://www.ethicsandtechnology.eu</a>) of the departments of
philosophy of Twente University, Delft University of Technology and
Eindhoven University of Technology.
Objectives
The aim of the PhD project is to perform a study of interpretations and
evaluations of new media and their consequences that are made by
representatives of major ideologies or worldviews, with the aim of
assessing how they relate to conceptions of the good life and the good
society held by these ideologies.  It will involve a study of liberal,
communitarian, conservative, religious and post materialist evaluations
of new media, and the assessment of what the benefits and harms of new
media cultures are and how these can be evaluated within these
ideologies.  It will also provide normative critiques of current
ideological stances regarding new media.
Profile
A Master&#x2019;s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy, preferably with a
background in ethics and/or social or political philosophy.
Consideration will also be given to candidates with a multidisciplinary
Master&#x2019;s degree on a topic relevant to the project and some background
in philosophy, and to exceptional (international) candidates with only a
bachelor&#x2019;s degree in philosophy.
Demonstrable interest in philosophical issues relating to information
technology and new media (but previous work in this area not required).
Good analytical skills. Good communication skills in English, in writing
as well as orally. Good team spirit.  Creativity, open-mindedness, and
an ability to develop new ideas.
Offer
A four-year full-time Ph.D. position, preferably starting April 1, 2008.
The gross salary is &#x20ac; 2.000,- in the first year going up to &#x20ac; 2.558,- in
the fourth year (&#x20ac; 27.456,- and &#x20ac; 35.699,- per annum, respectively,
including vacation pay and end-of-year bonus). The position also comes
with a personal budget of &#x20ac; 8.000,- for travel and conference attendance.
Information and application
A description of the PhD project, the overall project of which it is a
part and a FAQ can be retrieved from <a href="http://www.ceptes.nl/vici">http://www.ceptes.nl/vici</a>.
Applicants are advised to read these texts before applying. For
questions not answered on the website please contact the project leader,
Prof. dr. Philip Brey (e-mail: p.a.e.brey_at_utwente.nl).
Your application should contain the following documents: a letter of

Martin Clayton (OU), Laura Leante (OU), Glaura Lucas (OU - British
Academy Visiting Fellow)
Congado is a form of Afro-Brazilian ritual rich with music and dance
performance, often performed simultaneously by multiple independent
groups. The fact that each group attempts to play independently and
resist influence from other co-present groups makes the ritual an
ideal case study for the study of rhythmic coordination or
entrainment. The speakers filmed a two-day festival in May 2006, and
have been working colleboratively on the analysis of these recordings
during Dr Lucas's residency in the UK (Dec 07 - Feb 08). In this
seminar we will present the results of this analysis, and discuss the
relationship between the empirical and the ethnographic aspects of our work.

Subject: the decline-and-fall myth
Date: Sun, 03 Feb 2008 23:06:41 +0000
X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 710 (710)

Lubomir Dolezel begins his article "Possible Worlds of Fiction and
History", (New Literary History 29.4, 1998), as follows:
[deleted quotation]Except perhaps for the threat to interdisciplinarity, Dolezel's
statement must remind nearly everyone here of some other occasion
when someone has declared an imminent Information Deluge. Vannevar
Bush said more or less the same thing in his famous piece in Atlantic
Monthly, "As We May Think" (July 1945), in which he imagined
information technology not as the cause of the problem but as its solution:
[deleted quotation]A few days ago I listened to a lecture by a noted researcher
specializing in mobile telephony, who did not construct a Deluge from
an unquestioned surfeit of information (whatever that is) but spoke
of our radically increasing connectedness as a similar Force
threatening all sorts of things, such as peace of mind.  I am using
capitalization here, signifying personification, because mingled with
the facts of the matter and propelling them along, like the water of
a torrent carrying along rocks, tree branches and detrius of all
kinds, I hear the panic of a decline-and-fall, hell-in-a-handbasket
myth, which requires some god or superhuman force of destiny. I
suspect that there are facts to be got at, though every attempt I've
heard to calculate how much information there is and to predict how
much there will be never gets beyond measurable quanta (now commonly
reckoned in petabytes) to human perception and the psychology of
attention. It never questions *what information is*. I also find
myself wondering about a possible relationship between the supposed
decline-and-fall of the world and the certain biological
decline-and-fall of the doom-sayer.
Be that as it may, I wonder if a better response to Dolazel (and
mutatis mutandis to the others) is to point out that the real problem
in his formulation of the threat to interdisciplinarity is his
assumption that one should "master all the published literature in
all the special fields", as if the knowledge worth having were the
linear product of a cumulative process. Isn't it wiser to respond by
revising our idea of what knowledge is and to rethink our strategies
for getting it? Isn't it better to observe what we are in fact doing
e.g. with Google's 20 petabytes of data per day
(<a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2008/01/google-mapreduce-stats.html">http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2008/01/google-mapreduce-stats.html</a>)
and figure out how to do it well?

                                Eleventh International Conference on
                 Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
                         Sydney, Australia, September 16 - 19, 2008
                         Collocated with NMR-08, ICAPS-08, CP-08
                     The single registration fee includes attendance
                                to most events for all conferences
                                     <<a href="http://www.kr.org/KR2008/">http://www.kr.org/KR2008/</a>><a href="http://www.kr.org/KR2008/">http://www.kr.org/KR2008/</a>
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) is a vibrant and 
exciting field of human endeavour. KR&R techniques are key drivers of 
innovation in computer science, and they have led to significant 
advances in practical applications in a wide range of areas from 
Artificial Intelligence to Software Engineering.
Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by reasoning 
engines are an integral and crucial component of intelligent systems. 
Semantic Web technologies, the design of software agents and 
Bio-Informatics technologies, in particular, provide significant 
challenges for KR&R.
We intend KR2008 to be a forum for the exchange of new ideas, issues, 
and results among the community of researchers in the principles and 
practices of KR&R systems. We encourage papers presenting substantial 
new results in the principles of KR&R systems that clearly contribute 
to the formal foundations or show the applicability of the results to 
implemented or implementable systems. We also encourage ``reports 
from the field" of building knowledge bases, applications, 
experiments, developments, and tests. Such papers should be 
explicitly identified as reports from the field by the authors, to 
ensure appropriate reviewing, and should include a section on evaluation.
Papers must be submitted in AAAI style (pdf only)
                       <<<a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a>><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a>>
Paper length is 7 pages maximum including title, author information 
and references. Authors may add to the paper an optional, clearly 
marked Appendix containing technical material (such as proofs, 
evaluation results etc.) supporting claims made in the paper. The 
Appendix must not exceed 2 additional pages in AAAI style. The 
evaluation of the submission will be based on the quality of the 
paper. The optional Appendix will be used in case reviewers are in 
doubt about claimed results.
Submission will be through the Easychair conference management system
                  <<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008</a>><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008</a>
Conference proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. Final 
versions of papers will be considerably longer than the submissions: 
for each accepted paper 11 pages in AAAI style  will be allocated in 
the proceedings.
Topics of interest include:
- Exception tolerant and inconsistency-tolerant reasoning,
Paraconsistent logics
- Nonmonotonic logics, Default logics, Conditional logics, Argumentation

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 716 (716)

Dear Willard and All,
I hesitate to write (particularly at this time of the night) about
things I read years ago at Rice U. in philosophy/religion (although I
was engaged in a Physics B.A. then; only after that would I pursue
Religion) and in discussions at noon over computing possibilities (how
will we know "it" is truly intelligent; some  things never
change  :-)   )
But--from those conversations about knowledge and more and more of it,
I recall Michael Polanyi's idea that we don't master all the fields;
we overlap with each other so that through the overlaps we manage to
extend our 'grasp' of the material(s).  Connectedness???  I recently
was  reading a book by and then conversing with one of my colleagues
in art history about Dominican education (which it would have taken me
a long time to scour out what I was seeking) and finding that we, in
our rather "separate" fields, were interested in the same text: a
twelfth century text by an author I studied---a text cited in c13 and
later Dominican educational programs.  So, with a pedestrian example
we must all have experienced, I venture to say that the "overlap"
method of extension of "grasp" may well be a rather unsophisticated
way of saying that there are ways we will survive the flood (so to
speak).  But then there is the marvelous ability to trace (to which
you allude Willard), through the volumes scanned by Google, for
specific citations in books you may never have come across in ordinary
life.  Is this 'short circuiting' research or producing new 'paths'
for finding and connecting the pieces that we all work on?  Where does
it end? Or does it end?  Indeed, I think you are right: the question
is not to lament overload, but realize that we have more information,
more ways to "question" it, and a vast "grasp".  But how do we do this
best?  How to we do it responsibly? AND HOW do those of us who pursue
serious research at institutions that cannot afford the (medieval)
databases at hand in the large research universities continue on our
way??  Trips to the "big locations" (like Princeton, ND, or, ideally
London or Paris for a medievalist) or what?  Some things can be gotten
through consortia (OhioLink for library book loans is fabulous---and
fast).  But databases cost money.  On the other hand, manuscripts are
more accessible (so to speak) through some web pages, through rapid
Xerox copies of microfilm (much easier to read), etc.  Of course, you
need at some point to see the mss, but other times you just need the
"data'!  Well, I could ramble even more, but need to shut this down
and go read some Stephen Jay Gould for few minutes.
Well, so much for Ohio musings in the middle of the night (as a brief
conclusion to an evening of translating Gregory the Great; from the
sublime earlier to the mundane now.)
best to all

Shortly after Amy Friedlander was named director of programs of the
Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) last April, we asked
her to be a JEP guest editor, reprising her roles as editor of the online
magazine, iMP: The Magazine on Information Impacts, and as editor of D-Lib
Magazine. This time, we proposed, her job would be easier: she could put
together an issue without having to first establish the editorial policies
(as she had done with iMP and D-Lib).
Gracious and hardworking as always, Amy selected ten scholars and thinkers
and invited them to contribute to a Special Issue on Communications,
Scholarly Communications and the Advanced Research Infrastructure. She
supported them through the writing and editing, and produced this stunning
collection of articles from a stellar set of authors for your edification
and reading pleasure.
In Cyberscholarship: High Performance Computing Meets Digital Libraries,
William Y. Arms takes us into the world of high-performance computing and
shows us how the scholarly enterprise can change as computer scientists
work with researchers in other fields to apply new tools to data in
digital format. (Full disclosure here: Bill was founding publisher of
D-Lib, and Amy was founding editor.)

Jeremy Birnholtz looks at another face of cyberscholarship, the effect of
having a number of researchers, often from different fields, contributing
to one finding. In When Authorship Isn=92t Enough: Lessons from CERN on the

Digitization has made it possible not only to give more scholars access to
the surviving manuscripts of the Romance of the Rose that are locked in
libraries and archives around the world, it has given scholars more access
than even the original owners had in the Middle Ages. Stephen G. Nichols
tells that story in "Born Medieval": MSS. in the Digital Scriptorium.

Dear All,
Colleagues and students with interests in manuscripts, rare books, 3D
visualisation and electronic resources may be interested in attending
Turning the Pages 2.0
3D digital audio-facsimile of manuscripts and rare books
A 3DVisA seminar with Michael Stocking, Armadillo Systems
Organised by the JISC 3D Visualisation in the Arts Network (3DVisA)
Wednesday, 20 February 2008, 4pm
Seminar room, 2nd floor
Centre for Computing in the Humanities
King's College London
26-29 Drury Lane
London WC2B 5RL
Turning the Pages is a technology for creating interactive 3D facsimile of
books. It powers an ongoing digitisation programme of the most treasured,
illuminated manuscripts and rare books in the British Library, National
Library of Ireland, USA National Library of Medicine, and other libraries
and archives. For more information and links see 3DVisA Index of 3D
Projects, <a href="http://3dvisa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/project19.html">http://3dvisa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/project19.html</a>.
Introduced in 1998, the technology was originally available on local
terminals. Since 2001 it has been developed for the web by Armadillo
Systems. Michael Stocking will discuss the new version of software, TTP 2.0,
launched in 2007, which provides a more realistic 3D environment for the
books as well as new analytical tools. The partnership with Microsoft
indicates its future potential.
Some issues to be covered: 3D environment, the problem of scale, how do you
integrate 1000 books; how important is the user interface design, especially
for academic research? Features versus reach; the current use of markup
(XML) and potential for further development, open source versus proprietary,
technical standards (scanning, file formats and resolutions).
Alberto Campagniolo, an MA Digital Culture and Technology student at King's
will give an overview of the existing 3D techniques for the visualisation of
books.
It will be helpful if you use TTP in advance of the seminar and note any
questions you may have.

ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
'The Marriage of Mercury and Philology: Problems and Outcomes in
Digital Philology'
International Seminar of Digital Philology
Edinburgh, March 25th - 27th, 2008
Venue:  e-Science Institute, 15 South College Street, Edinburgh
The conference is organised and hosted by the e-Science Institute,
National e-Science Centre, and supported by the University of
Edinburgh, the Italian Institute in Edinburgh, and the French Institute
in Edinburgh.
ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
In late Antiquity, at the beginning of a new era, Martianus Cappella
wrote his 'De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'  in which he proposed a
then revolutionary synthesis of technique (Mercury) and culture
(Philology). Inspired by Cappella, this conference will explore the
interaction between Information and Communication Technology systems
and the philological analysis of both ancient and modern manuscripts
and printed texts: in other words Digital Philology.
The discussions at this conference focus on both the theoretical and
practical issues encountered in the creation of digital texts and both
critical and genetic editions. The implications for research and
teaching will be examined and current projects in the field will be
presented. The aim of the conference is to approach these issues from
an international perspective, in order to establish collaboration in
research and teaching, and to provide new contributions to the field as
a result. Workshops will provide a forum for discussing experiences,
ideas, issues and new tools related to Digital Philology with students.
The conference welcomes both leading scholars and young researchers
working on the problems of textual criticism and editorial scholarship
in the electronic medium, as well as students, teachers, librarians,
archivists, and computing professionals who are interested in
representation, access, exchange, management and conservation of texts.
WEBCAST
The conference will be webcast in order to allow wider participation.
The link to the webcast will appear on the e-Science Institute website
<a href="http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/854/index.cfm">http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/854/index.cfm</a>. 1 hour before the
workshop / webcast is due to be broadcast.
KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
   The conference aims to encourage international conversations and
networking between participants in different projects and countries,
and to offer an international perspective on the issues of textual
criticism and editorial scholarship in the electronic medium. As the
conference is actively promoting a European perspective, speakers will
come from different European countries. Keynote speakers will be
academic scholars renowned in the field of Digital Philology. The
following have confirmed their participation:
Peter Robinson, University of Birmingham, UK;
Jean-Louis Lebrave, Institut des Textes et Manuscrits, CNRS / ENS, France;
Paolo D'Iorio, Institut des Textes et Manuscrits CNRS / ENS, France;
Domenico Fiormonte, Roma Tre University, Rome, Italy;
Andrea Bozzi, Istituto Linguistica Computazionale, CNR, Pisa, Italy;
Edward Vanhoutte, CTB - Centrum voor Teksteditie en Bronnenstudie,
Koningstraat, Belgium;
Manfred Thaller, University of Cologne, Germany.
SUBMISSIONS
-TOPICS:
We welcome proposals that discuss any aspect of the interaction
between ICT and philology.
In order to provide a good overview of the current state of Digital
Philology, the conference will focus on four main topics:
1.	Tools:
Pieces of software; technologies and multimedia tools employed to
create digital critical and genetic editions; multimedia archives and
collaborative publications (representation, cataloguing, collation,
comparison, textual analysis, textual genesis, interchange, management
and preservation of manuscripts and printed editions in
text/image/audio/video format).
2.	Products:
Digital critical and genetic editions, multimedia archives, and
collaborative publications available on CD-ROMs and/or on the World
Wide Web (current projects, work in progress, updates on continuing
mature projects).
3.	Methodologies:
Impact of ICT on philological studies
Methodological approaches used when preparing a digital edition
Accomplishment of a digital edition that is truly new and innovative
What ICT in textual criticism enables scholars to do that could not be
done before
Digital philology as 'traditional' philology in a new fashion
Digital philology as a new discipline in itself
Relation between digital and traditional philology
Collaborative publication of digital editions / Collaborative
philological research in a virtual environment.
4.	Learning/Teaching:
The use of critical and genetic editions and multimedia archives in
learning/teaching languages, linguistics, literature, history,
palaeography, creative writing, textual criticism, digital philology.
-TYPES OF PROPOSAL:
Paper:
Proposals for papers should be no less than 750 words. Papers will be
allocated 50 minutes for presentation, including a 10 minute question-
answer session.
Workshop:
Proposals for workshops should be no less than 500 words. Workshops
will be allocated 50 minutes for presentation, including 30 minutes of
collaborative work.
There should be no difference in quality between papers and workshop
presentations. The same academic standards should apply in both cases,
but workshops may be a more suitable way of presenting projects with
teaching and interactive purposes, since they provide an opportunity
for students to exchange ideas, methods and techniques with
international scholars. The choice between the two modes of
presentation should depend on the most effective and informative way of
communicating the scientific content of the proposal.
Proposals are peer-reviewed.
-FORMAT OF PROPOSAL
All proposals must be uploaded onto the Call for Papers page on the e-
Science website <a href="http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/854/proposal.cfm">http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/854/proposal.cfm</a> in
PDF, PPT format.  Please pay particular attention to the format given

=============================================================
<a href="http://www.nn.isep.ipp.pt">http://www.nn.isep.ipp.pt</a>  email: nn-2008@isep.ipp.pt
GENERAL INFORMATION
The Summer School will be held at Porto, Portugal, jointly organized
by the Polytechnic School of Engineering of Porto (ISEP) and the
Faculty of Engineering, Porto University (FEUP).
Following last year experience, this year's edition also includes a
POSTER/WORKSHOP SESSION providing a discussion forum where the
participants can obtain peer guidance for their projects.
[...]
COURSE CONTENTS
Neural networks (NN) have become a very important tool in
classification and regression tasks. The applications are nowadays
abundant, e.g. in the engineering, economy and biology areas. The
Summer School on NN is dedicated to explain relevant NN paradigms,
namely multilayer perceptrons (MLP), radial basis function networks
(RBF) and support vector machines (SVM) used for classification and
regression tasks, illustrated with applications to real data.
Specific topics are also presented, namely Multi-Valued and UB
Neurons , Functional Networks , MLP's with Entropic Criteria and Data
Mining using NN.
Classes include practical sessions with appropriate software tools.
The trainee has, therefore, the opportunity to apply the taught
concepts and become conversant with a broad range of NN topics and
applications. A special workshop session will provide a discussion
forum where the participants can obtain peer guidance for their projects.
PRELIMINARY PROGRAMME
A preliminary programme and further information about the classes are

                                     <<a href="http://www.kr.org/KR2008/">http://www.kr.org/KR2008/</a>><a href="http://www.kr.org/KR2008/">http://www.kr.org/KR2008/</a>
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) is 
a vibrant and exciting field of human endeavour. 
KR&R techniques are key drivers of innovation in 
computer science, and they have led to 
significant advances in practical applications in 
a wide range of areas from Artificial Intelligence to Software Engineering.
Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated 
by reasoning engines are an integral and crucial 
component of intelligent systems. Semantic Web 
technologies, the design of software agents and 
Bio-Informatics technologies, in particular, 
provide significant challenges for KR&R.
We intend KR2008 to be a forum for the exchange 
of new ideas, issues, and results among the 
community of researchers in the principles and 
practices of KR&R systems. We encourage papers 
presenting substantial new results in the 
principles of KR&R systems that clearly 
contribute to the formal foundations or show the 
applicability of the results to implemented or 
implementable systems. We also encourage 
``reports from the field" of building knowledge 
bases, applications, experiments, developments, 
and tests. Such papers should be explicitly 
identified as reports from the field by the 
authors, to ensure appropriate reviewing, and 
should include a section on evaluation.
Papers must be submitted in AAAI style (pdf only)
<<<a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a>><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a>>
Paper length is 7 pages maximum including title, 
author information and references. Authors may 
add to the paper an optional, clearly marked 
Appendix containing technical material (such as 
proofs, evaluation results etc.) supporting 
claims made in the paper. The Appendix must not 
exceed 2 additional pages in AAAI style. The 
evaluation of the submission will be based on the 
quality of the paper. The optional Appendix will 
be used in case reviewers are in doubt about claimed results.
Submission will be through the Easychair conference management system
<<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008</a>><a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008</a>
Conference proceedings will be published by AAAI 
Press. Final versions of papers will be 
considerably longer than the submissions: for 
each accepted paper 11 pages in AAAI style  will 
be allocated in the proceedings.
Topics of interest include:
- Exception tolerant and inconsistency-tolerant reasoning,
Paraconsistent logics

I am finding some assistance to thinking about the future of
humanities computing by digging into its past. In Edmund A Bowles,
ed., Computers and Humanistic Research (Prentice-Hall, 1967), for
example, Philip Smith, in "The Computer and the Humanist", pp 16-28,
reviews progress to that date, or what he calls "a hopeful note about
the future": the promise of automation of input, looking to the day
when machines will be able to read "any type font that we may
present", though this, he says, may require that we tear our books
apart; printing achieved at 600 lines/minute; a general understanding
of what computers can and cannot do without learning how to program
expertly; programming languages developed for the humanist;
time-sharing on mainframes, so that we can all operate as if we had
our own machines; etc. "To sum up this prognosis, the ending is
happy, in true American tradition."
Fulfillment of the promise he sketches is not a taxing nor a surprising
matter to delineate, even if some unforeseen changes must be
supplied, e.g. by personal computers, the Web and so forth. There is
no disturbance to a story of progress, nothing in particular to learn
other than to qualify one's predictions. More or less the same continues
in remarks by the volume editor, in "Toward a Research of New
Dimensions" (pp. 8-15), with an important exception I'll get to
in a moment. Citing a widely quoted humanist of the time,
Ephim Fogel (who invented the term "vision-actuality interval", or
VAI,to caution his colleagues that patience is required), Bowles notes that,
[deleted quotation]Bowles goes on to detail other advantages -- the computer provides "an
infinitely more reliable repository than the mind of the proverbial
absent-minded professor"; it "permits the scholar to broaden his data
base, for the first time making possible the comprehensive inclusion
of all relevant material"; it can "simulate a problem or situation"
(by which Bowles means "model"), thus saving time in research; it is
not subject to "the vagaries of human fatigue". Again, there is
little here to object to, and in the case of the remark about
conversation with a programmer much for some of us still to learn
about collaborative research, as my colleague Harold Short has
pointed out. But one can be excused for feeling that something here
is missing amidst all this talk of progress, most of which has been
achieved without great upheaval.
A bit later on Bowles responds to a question circulated at a
conference at Yale two years  earlier: "What can a computer do?"
[deleted quotation]I suppose you have to be a pedestrian or a cyclist to see the problem
here, and so the question that is never addressed, so far as I can
tell, in this book, and, alas all too seldom since then. To continue
with the automotive metaphor, what happens to one's sense of
going once one becomes a driver? What happens to a city whose
urban planners think only in terms of the automobile?
Yours,
WM

Willard, quoting Philip Smith's mention of "programming languages
developed for the humanist", prompts me to share the following. Eighteen
years ago, I published with Prentice-Hall -- the same publisher as
published Smith's comments -- a book I called "Icon Programming for
Humanists." "Icon" in this context has nothing to do with the now common
use of the word which came along subsequently, but is simply the name of a
programming language that is especially adapted to dealing with texts. I
showed in the book how Icon could be fruitfully applied to stylistics, in
particular to the rigorous procedures suggested by Anthony Kenny in his
1982 book "The Computation of Style," but there carried out manually. At
the urging of Clinton Jeffery, Professor of Computer Science at the
University of Idaho, I have embarked on a second, updated edition of this
book, which will take into account the truly amazing changes in computing
that have occurred over the past two decades. Professor Jeffery is
enthusiastically cooperating with me in this effort, which will be made
available, later this year hopefully, on the Internet without charge. He
comments in his foreword to the book that "books on text processing are
few and far between." I have also included a new chapter on working with
Unicode for non-Roman scripts, giving Russian, Tamil, and Hebrew as
examples.  Humanists might want to encourage programmers to consider this
language for projects on which they embark. It is a relatively easy
language to learn, and can greatly expedite text processing. The standard
manual of the language is available on line at
